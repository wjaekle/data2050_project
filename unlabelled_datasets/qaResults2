Question: Why was the Tet offensive launched
Answer:  The Tet Offensive was one of the largest military operations of the Vietnam War, and became a key turning point in the conflict.The Tet Offensive was a surprise series of attacks launched during Tet, the Vietnamese New Year festival. Many South Vietnamese troops were on holiday when the attacks began, and the military was caught off guard. In the wake of the Tet Offensive, popular U.S. journalist Walter Cronkite said, “We are mired in a stalemate [and] the only rational way out, then, will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy and did the best they could.”  The Tet Offensive played an important role in weakening U.S. public support for the war in Vietnam. These were launched by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops. It showed American forces in Vietnam that the Viet Cong were a formidable enemy. The Tet Offensive was a coordinated series of North Vietnamese attacks on more than 100 cities and outposts in South Vietnam. The offensive was an attempt to foment rebellion among the South Vietnamese population and encourage the United States to scale back its involvement in the Vietnam War.
------------------------------
Question: how did the anti-war movement in the US react to the Tet offensive
Answer:  The events of Tet in early 1968 as a whole were also remarkable in shifting public opinion regarding the war. The military victories on the battlefields of Tet were obscured by shocking images of violence on television screens, long casualty lists, and a new perception among the American people that the military had been untruthful to them about the success of earlier military operations, and ultimately, the ability to achieve a meaningful military solution in Vietnam. Eugene McCarthy ran against him for the nomination on an anti-war platform. Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey, also ran for the nomination, promising to continue to support the South Vietnamese government. On October 15, 1969, hundreds of thousands of people took part in National Moratorium anti-war demonstrations across the United States; the demonstrations prompted many workers to call in sick from their jobs and adolescents nationwide engaged in truancy from school.

Question: how dangerous is the omicron mutation of corona virus
Answer:  Chan School of Public Health, and other researchers said that vaccines will most likely protect against Omicron, but further studies are needed to determine how much of the shots’ effectiveness may be reduced. As the coronavirus replicates inside people, new mutations constantly arise. Most provide the virus with no new advantage. When worrisome mutations do emerge, the World Health Organization uses Greek letters to name the variants. Omicron first came to light in Botswana, where researchers at the Botswana Harvard H.I.V. Dr. de Oliveira and his colleagues asked the W.H.O. The researchers found more than 30 mutations on a protein, called spike, on the surface of the coronavirus. The spike protein is the chief target of antibodies that the immune system produces to fight a Covid-19 infection. So many mutations raised concerns that Omicron’s spike might be able to evade antibodies produced by either a previous infection or a vaccine.

Question: Where are most refugee camps located?
Answer:  Aida (Arabic: ???? ??????), also spelled ‘Ayda, is a Palestinian refugee camp situated 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the historic centre of Bethlehem and 1 km (0.62 mi) north of Beit Jala, in the central West Bank. According to the UNRWA, the camp had a population of approximately 5,498 refugees at the end of 2014. Today, there are more refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) than at any point since World War II. Kakuma (Kenya) Population (2015): 184,550. Hagadera (Kenya) Dagahaley (Kenya) Ifo (Kenya) Zaatari (Jordan) Yida (South Sudan) Katumba (Tanzania) REFUGEE CAMPS IN Lebanon  Malta is the Western country that has received the most refugees relative to its population. The pressure has become even greater since Italy has made it almost impossible for rescue vessels to dock at its own ports.
------------------------------
Question: What are the conditions of the refugee camps?
Answer:  Although not all refugees live in refugee camps, the large population of refugees means conditions in refugee camps can be extremely cramped, underfunded, dirty and dangerous. People living in refugee camps complain of the amount of trash, rape, crime, lack of any kind of opportunity and the seeming permanence of their situation. On average refugees will remain in refugee camps for 12 years, according to the New York Times. Most refugee camps resemble dirty, crowded prisons where people must learn to cope with suffering and desperation on a daily basis. However, some refugee camps offer residents more dignified conditions. Refugee camps are essentially a prison; once you enter you are not allowed to leave or reenter. “Camps offer no work possibilities, and just like in prison, you receive your daily portion of food and water and are asked to wait, hopelessly, passively.”- Aziz Abu Sarah (Sarah, 2013). The conditions of Syrian camps continue to devalue the human life of Syrians; they are treated inhumanely, and abused.
------------------------------
Question: Where are the largest refugee camps located?
Answer:  Established in 1992, Kakuma camp is located in Northwestern Kenya. Kakuma is co-managed by Kenya’s Department of Refugee Affairs, and the UNHCR. The majority of refugees in this camp are South Sudanese (100,000), followed by Somalis (55,000). There are also refugees from 20 other nations stationed here. Most displaced people at Kakuma fled their homes as a result of civil war. There are minimal opportunities for employment, and cases of disease and malnutrition are very common. It’s not just the largest refugee camp in Africa, its also currently the world’s largest refugee camp, it hosts over 184,000 people with majority from south sudan and somali and is co-managed by Kenya’s Department of Refugee Affairs, and the UNHCR.

Question: What is durga puja?
Answer:  Durga Puja, also known as Durgotsava or Sharodotsava, is an annual Hindu festival originating in the Indian subcontinent which reveres and pays homage to the Hindu goddess Durga and is also celebrated because of Durga's victory over Mahishasur. It is particularly popular and traditionally celebrated in the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tripura, Assam, Maharastra, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Uttrakhand and the country of Bangladesh. The festival is observed in the Indian calendar month of Ashwin, which corresponds to September–October in the Gregorian calendar. The puja is performed in homes and public, the latter featuring a temporary stage and structural decorations (known as pandals). The festival is also marked by scripture recitations, performance arts, revelry, gift-giving, family visits, feasting, and public processions. Also known as Ma Durga (Mother Durga), this goddess symbolizes the power of women, which includes both her nurturing aspect and her fierce warrior. In the fall, when the weather turns milder, and many flowers are in bloom, Durga returns from her husband’s home in Kailash, in the Himalaya, to visit her family in West Bengal.

Question: onde se concentram atualmente os campos de refugiados
Answer:  Recebem o nome de campos de refugiados determinadas áreas onde se reúnem pessoas deslocadas de suas moradias originais devido a fatores políticos, sociais, naturais ou econômicos. Localizados no mesmo país ou região de conflito, na fronteira ou em outro lugar próximo, os campos de refugiados são assentamentos de estruturas precárias, de estadia temporária (teoricamente) e com condições sanitárias mínimas, ocupados geralmente por populações sem qualquer renda ou que perderam todas as suas posses. O desespero se agrava nos lugares onde se concentram dezenas de milhares de refugiados internos que chegaram a Cabul procedentes de zonas tomadas anteriormente pelo Talibã, como Herat e Kunduz e que agora estão novamente retidos pela milícia islâmica. Distribuem-se em numerosos acampamentos improvisados por toda Cabul. Num deles há quase 60 mulheres que trabalhavam como policiais e que agora, sem uniforme, tratam de se esconder do Talibã, para que não saibam qual era sua antiga profissão.

Question: what are some good rules of screenplay writing
Answer:  Since a familiarity with the basics of the craft is half the battle, The Writers Store has provided you with resources, a screenplay example, and overview on how to write a screenplay to help you get up to speed on screenwriting fundamentals. In the most basic terms, a screenplay is a 90-120 page document written in Courier 12pt font on 8 1/2" x 11" bright white three-hole punched paper. One formatted script page in Courier font equals roughly one minute of screen time. Comedies tend to be on the shorter side (90 pages, or 1 ½ hours) while Dramas run longer (120 pages, or 2 hours). A general rule of thumb is that each section of description should be contained to four lines or less. An orphan is a word or very short line that appears at the end of your description. Joe sleeps on the sofa.

Question: what is machine learning?
Answer:  Machine learning brings out the power of data in new ways, such as Facebook suggesting articles in your feed. This amazing technology helps computer systems learn and improve from experience by developing computer programs that can automatically access data and perform tasks via predictions and detections. As you input more data into a machine, this helps the algorithms teach the computer, thus improving the delivered results. When you ask Alexa to play your favorite music station on Amazon Echo, she will go to the station you played most often. You can further improve and refine your listening experience by telling Alexa to skip songs, adjust the volume, and many more possible commands. Machine Learning and the rapid advance of Artificial Intelligence makes this all possible. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

Question: How does blockchain work?
Answer:  The more coins a user has, the higher his/her score will be. Additionally, if you harvest more, your importance score will increase. Users would use their available hard drive capacity to select mining rights instead of using computational power. So, the larger your hard drive would be, the more you can validate blocks. Instead of only relying on how many coins you staked, the system stakes into other factors into account to weigh in. So, even if you have fewer coins, you may still get to participate in consensus. While many people have a general understanding of how a block chain works, they are still unsure about how it will work for them. In essence, the blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that enables transactions in a business network to be recorded. It can be used to track all types of assets – from tangible to intangible – and minimizes costs and risk for both parties.

Question: what is the difference between classification and prediction problems?
Answer:  Of course, for the pedantically focused, it might be possible to identify ?ne differences between all these, but the reality for the practitioner is that in a practical sense, these are interchangeable terms when it comes to creating applications. The problems solved, i.e., prediction, classi?cation and clustering, are roughly the same. For estimation problems, where a number needs to be predicted, people think of how far the predictions are from actually observed quantities (technically measured as rootmean-square-error [RMSE]). For example, many algorithms are used to make a prediction, and then the value predicted by the majority of the algorithms in the ensemble is used as a ?nal prediction.

Question: will inflation go up or down?
Answer:  In the same piece, Summers accused the administration of denying “even the possibility of inflation,” raising concerns that Biden wasn’t adequately prepared for the rise in prices that coincided with sweeping stimulus packages, and didn’t have the proper measures in place to act quickly to bring inflation down. That concern — that the administration wouldn’t act quickly and that inflation would become a longer-term problem, rather than the transitory issue Biden predicted — is playing out, at least somewhat. So far, as November’s numbers show, inflation isn’t letting up. Indeed, while consumer confidence leaped higher from the lows of the pandemic around April 2020 for a solid year after, it has come down substantially since, coinciding with the rise of inflation to its highest pace in more than 30 years. The University of Michigan's closely watched index of consumer sentiment for August slumped to around its lowest level in nearly a decade.

Question: How is ML different from AI
Answer:  Concisely, AI can be described as the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans. As such, AI is a general field that encompasses machine learning and deep learning, but that also includes many more approaches that may not involve any learning. Early chess programs, for instance, only involved hardcoded rules crafted by programmers, and didn’t qualify as machine learning. In fact, for a fairly long time, most experts believed that human-level artificial intelligence could be achieved by having programmers  handcraft  a  sufficiently  large  set  of  explicit  rules  for  manipulating knowledge stored in explicit databases. It was the dominant paradigm in AI from the 1950s to the late 1980s, and it reached its peak popularity during the expert systems boom of the 1980s. Although  symbolic  AI  proved  suitable  to  solve  well-defined,  logical  problems, such as playing chess, it turned out to be intractable to figure out explicit rules for solving more complex, fuzzy problems, such as image classification, speech recognition, or natural language translation. In  Victorian  England,  Lady  Ada  Lovelace  was  a  friend  and  collaborator  of  Charles Babbage,  the  inventor  of  the  Analytical  Engine:  the  first-known  general-purpose mechanical  computer.

Question: How many layers to include in a deep learning network?
Answer:  How  many  layers  contribute  to  a model of the data is called the depth of the model. Meanwhile, other approaches to machine learning tend to focus on learning only one or two layers of representations of the data (say, taking a pixel histogram and  then  applying  a  classification  rule);  hence,  they’re  sometimes  called  shallow learning. In deep learning, these layered representations are learned via models called neural networks, structured in literal layers stacked on top of each other. The term “neural network” refers to neurobiology, but although some of the central concepts in deep learning  were  developed  in  part  by  drawing  inspiration  from  our  understanding  of the brain (in particular, the visual cortex), deep learning models are not models of the brain. Having common benchmarks  that  researchers  compete  to  beat  has  greatly  helped  the  rise  of  deep learning, by highlighting its success against classical machine learning approaches. In addition to hardware and data, until the late 2000s, we were missing a reliable way to train very deep neural networks.

Question: What is neural style transfer?
Answer:  Neural style transfer consists of applying the style of a reference image to a target image while conserving the content of the target image. Content target Style reference Combination image Figure 12.9 A style transfer example In  this  context,  style  essentially  means  textures,  colors,  and  visual  patterns  in  the image, at various spatial scales, and the content is the higher-level macrostructure of the  image. Neural style transfer 383 12.2.2 Wrapping up ? DeepDream consists of running a convnet in reverse to generate inputs based on the representations learned by the network.

Answer: 
------------------------------
Question: What activation function to use for classification?
Answer:  Since 2013, a wide array of techniques has been developed for visualizing and interpreting these representations. 9.4.1 Visualizing intermediate activations Visualizing intermediate activations consists of displaying the values returned by various convolution and pooling layers in a model, given a certain input (the output of a layer is often called its activation, the output of the activation function). Each  channel  encodes  relatively  independent  features,  so  the  proper  way  to  visualize these feature maps is by independently plotting the contents of every channel as a 2D image. def get_img_array(img_path, target_size): img = keras.utils.load_img( img_path, target_size=target_size) Open the image file and resize it. array = keras.utils.img_to_array(img) array = np.expand_dims(array, axis=0) return array img_tensor = get_img_array(img_path, target_size=(180, 180)) Turn the image into a float32 NumPy array of shape (180, 180, 3). Interpreting what convnets learn 273 Figure 9.17 Some filter patterns for layers block2_sepconv1, block4_sepconv1, and block8_sepconv1 9.4.3 Visualizing heatmaps of class activation We’ll introduce one last visualization technique—one that is useful for understanding which parts of a given image led a convnet to its final classification decision.

Question: nerve supply of tongue
Answer:  The tongue has a very rich neurovascular supply, and its importance in humans is tightly connected to the digestive system and speech. This becomes even clearer when some of these structures are damaged. Functional anatomy Muscles Mucosa Lymphatics Innervation Hypoglossal nerve Vagus nerve Glossopharyngeal nerve Lingual nerve Facial nerve Tongue innervation summary Clinical case Sources Muscles Mucosa Arteries Veins Hypoglossal nerve Vagus nerve Glossopharyngeal nerve Lingual nerve Facial nerve Tongue innervation summary  Even though the second pharyngeal arch does not contribute to a visible structure on the surface of the tongue, a part of its nerve supply – the chorda tympani; a branch of the facial nerve (CN VII) – carries special afferent signals from the taste buds? (excluding vallate papillae) of the presulcal part of the tongue. The vallate papillae, along with the mucosa of the postsulcal part of the tongue, pass afferent stimuli to the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX); which is the nerve of the third pharyngeal arch. This innervation is also supplemented by the nerve of the fourth pharyngeal arch – the vagus nerve (CN X) – which carries sensory stimuli from the base of the tongue that is anterior to the epiglottis. Recall that both intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue arise from occipital myotomes that migrated ventrally to populate the developing tongue. As a result, the migrating myocytes took the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) along with it. Therefore, CN XII provides efferent stimuli to all the muscles of the tongue. The exception to this rule is palatoglossus, which derives its motor supply from the pharyngeal plexus.

Question: What is the root cause of the Fukushima Disaster
Answer:  [xx2]A [xx2]A [xx2]A [xx2]A [xx2]A The Fukushima accident was an accident in 2011 at the Fukushima Daiichi (“Number One”) nuclear power plant in Japan. It is the second worst nuclear accident in the history of nuclear power generation, behind the Chernobyl disaster.
------------------------------
Question: what is root cause of fukushima disaster
Answer:  INSAG-27 report (IAEA, 2017) indicates that “the root causes of the accident were identified by the Report of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) of the National Diet of Japan as being cultural and institutional. That is, the overall safety system was ineffective.” It should be noted that the INSAG-27 report originates from references to national and international institutions in the nuclear industry and does not contain references to scientific publications. The key message of the report is that high levels of nuclear safety are achieved by strong and effective institutions that reinforce each other to jointly ensure proper application of standards and following best nuclear industry practices. According to the INSAG-27 report, the term “institution” is used to signify “the totality of stakeholders (people, nongovernmental organizations, media, shareholders, neighbors), even if views among stakeholders may be different.” A national nuclear safety system is characterized by interactions between different nuclear industry stakeholders, including design organizations, vendors, constructors, suppliers, operators, regulatory bodies, technical support organizations, governments, local communities, the media, and civil society, that together constitute the institutional field. This study explores root causes of the Fukushima Daiichi disaster and discusses how an urgent situation, such as a station blackout (SBO), should be addressed on an organizational and managerial level so that future disasters may be prevented. Second, it is verified that these malfunctions were caused by failures of organizational risk and crisis management.

Question: reinforcement learning
Answer:  Reinforcement Learning is an aspect of Machine learning where an agent learns to behave in an environment, by performing certain actions and observing the rewards/results which it get from those actions. With the advancements in Robotics Arm Manipulation, Google Deep Mind beating a professional Alpha Go Player, and recently the OpenAI team beating a professional DOTA player, the field of reinforcement learning has really exploded in recent years. This neural network learning method helps you to learn how to attain a complex objective or maximize a specific dimension over many steps.

Question: distillBERT
Answer:  Recent publications within NLP present models with parameter counts that one after another continues to increase, now reaching parameter counts as high as in the tenths of billions (Google T5 with 11B parameters). While more parameters might be the key to optimal performance does it prevent model training and serving where the computational budget might be limited. DistillBERT is able to achieve 97% of BERT-base’s score on the GLUE benchmark and 99.3% on the IMDb classification task. This while reducing model size and computational time with around 40%.

Question: what is libido
Answer:  Psychologically, they re?ect the unconscious human desire to return to the inanimate state, and are 7.7 What is the libido, and with what part of the mind is it associated? Psychic Structure: Anatomy of the Mind (cid:2) 161 expressed in destructive aggressive behavior, including the self-aggressive and suicidal. This death drive also may be seen as a re?ection in Freud’s thinking of the fact that humans, like all organisms and all living cells, are, in a sense, fated to die. Broadly, it is a psychological parallel to the biological concept of metabolism—the biological term for the chemical processes and energy involved in the building up (anabolism) of protoplasm and living matter, and its wasting and destruction (catabolism). Libido The life instincts generate Libido—the ?nite amount of energy that Freud assumed was within each person. In the course of development, Libido becomes attached to, or ?xed on, aspects of the internal and external environment. The energy available to the organism is continuously transformed, ?xed onto different ‘‘objects.’’ Note that ‘‘objects’’ was a term that Freud and his followers used to refer to people and zones of the human body, not just inanimate things.

Question: who is george kelly
Answer:  Long before ‘‘cognitive psychology’’ existed, Kelly (1955) created a cognitive theory of personality, a theory in which how people construe and think is at the core. The basics of that theory were described in Chapter 12, and were fundamental for the development of the Phenomenological-Humanistic Level. Personal construct theory George Kelly’s theoretical approach to personality that tries to see how the person sees or aligns events on his or her own dimensions. Personal meaning system The individual’s system of concepts and feelings that guides and constrains how he or she interprets the self and the world. Personal narratives The stories people tell themselves to try to make sense of their own lives and experiences.

Question: Is marijuana bad for you?
Answer:  Putting the debate about addiction, lung cancer, and progression to harder drugs aside, the most concerning marijuana health risks can be found among demographics who medical experts suggest should avoid cannabis altogether or consult a healthcare professional before using it. A bump in legalization in many places has young people asking, “Is marijuana bad for you?” For juveniles thinking of using it recreationally, the answer is a definite yes. Studies have shown that any potentially harmful effects of marijuana are particularly pronounced in younger people because their brains are still developing. In 2015, Jacobus and Tapert published Effects of Cannabis on the Adolescent Brain, an article that detailed the negative impact marijuana can have on teenagers’ neurocognitive performance, brain development, as well as their brain function. Studies such as this have led experts to recommend that young people abstain from marijuana use. One of the common reasons people give for why cannabis might be bad for you is the idea that it's a "gateway drug.

Question: Can consciousness be reduced to brain activity?
Answer:  How physical systems give rise to subjective experience is dubbed the “hard problem” of consciousness. Although neuroscientists can measure the crackling of electrical activity among neurons and their networks, no one understands how consciousness emerges from individual spikes. The sense of awareness and self simply can’t be reduced down to neuronal pulses, at least with our current state of understanding. A broad stroke describes it as a capacity to experience something, including one’s own existence, rather than documenting it like an automaton—a vague enough picture that leaves plenty of room for theories to how consciousness actually works. There were vigorous debates on the topic, with some members of the group arguing that consciousness eventually could be accounted for by particular patterns of activity in the brain: Once we understood exactly how the brain works, we would see how consciousness arises from it. Others, however, argued that the awareness of our experience—the feeling of what it’s like to see the color green or to fall in love—could never be reduced to on-or-off patterns of neurons, no matter how complex the patterning.

Question: What is the meaning of life?
Answer:  Life is defined scientifically as a continuous existence between a sequence of moments and within a species. Because matter is more likely to dissolve into matter after a certain period of time, Life Quotes exists in a higher state than matter. But, life has the ability to maintain its unity even after all matter has been destroyed. According to scientific standards, there is only one form of life. It is the human form. by stating that one's life reflects one's will, and that the will (life) is an aimless, irrational, and painful drive. Salvation, deliverance, and escape from suffering are in aesthetic contemplation, sympathy for others, and asceticism.

Question: What did Nietzsche say about God?
Answer:  The people in the marketplace did not believe in God, but to a large extent their lives would have been shaped by a memory of this belief. What Nietzsche is saying in The Madman is not that God is dead so let’s throw a party, he is saying that God is dead and he must be replaced with something. In the post-Enlightenment world, faith in God had been replaced with faith in science. But Nietzsche, himself an atheist, insists that a person cannot live a faith-free life. In his book The Gay Science (1882), Nietzsche declared that “God is dead” which, essentially, was his way of saying that belief in the Christian conception of God had become unbelievable (1). Neither did Nietzsche mince his words when it came to Christianity as a religion itself:

Question: What is a word in psychology for measuring the same thing in two ways and claiming to find a correlation?
Answer: 
------------------------------
Question: What is a word in psychology for measuring the same thing in two ways and claiming to find a correlation?
Answer:  Often, two or more variables seem to be associated—seem to ‘‘go together’’—in such a way that when we know something about one variable, we can usually make a good guess about the other variables. For example, people who are taller generally tend to weigh more; when we know how tall someone is, we can roughly predict the person’s weight. This ‘‘going together,’’ ‘‘co-relationship,’’ or joint relationship between variables is what psychologists mean by the term correlation. Correlation coef?cients can range from ?1.00 through .00 to +1.00. A coef?cient of +1.00 means that there is a perfect positive relation between X and Y—that is, the person having the highest score on X also has the highest score on Y, the person having the second highest score on X has the second highest score on Y, and so on. A correlation of ?1.00 signi?es a perfect negative relation so that the higher a person’s score is on X, the lower the score on Y.

Question: How can God be realized?
Answer:  Jul 2, 2020·3 min read Jul 2, 2020·3 min read A person is said to have Self-Realized when he realizes that the Self i.e. the real ‘I’ is the Supreme Soul (Parmatma / God), and not the body or the name that the world identifies himself to be.’ A Self-Realized being has attained this real knowledge of the Self. By realizing the impersonal Brahman, one simply realizes the effulgence emanating from the transcendental body of Krishna. This effulgence is compared to the sunshine. There is the sun-god, the sun itself and the sunshine which is the shining effulgence of that original sun-god.

Question: How to programatically detect if a pdf is scanned
Answer:  Is there any way in C# I can detect if the PDF is scanned file on a normal one? So, I can show the user an appropriate message. If it fails, report to uploader that his PDF is not good for the purpose. – mkl – Jongware Dec 26 '17 at 23:21 To see if a page has any text you could use the Doc.GetText method (and test the length of the string it returns). If this is more about actually detecting if PDF was created by scanning rather than pdf has images instead of text then you might need to dig into the metadata of the file, not just content. Scanned files have less than 1000chars/page vs. non scanned ones who always have more than 1000chars/page Multiple independent scanned files had "Canon" listed as the PDF creator, probably referencing Canon scanner software PDFs with "Microsoft Word" as creator are likely to not be scanned, as they are word exports. But someone could scan to word, then export to PDF - some people have very strange workflow.

Question: How does a quantum computer work?
Answer:  A quantum computer is a computer design which uses the principles of quantum physics to increase the computational power beyond what is attainable by a traditional computer. Quantum computers have been built on a small scale and work continues to upgrade them to more practical models. Computers function by storing data in a binary number format, which result in a series of 1s & 0s retained in electronic components such as transistors. Each component of computer memory is called a bit and can be manipulated through the steps of Boolean logic so that the bits change, based upon the algorithms applied by the computer program, between the 1 and 0 modes (sometimes referred to as "on" and "off"). A quantum computer, on the other hand, would store information as either a 1, 0, or a quantum superposition of the two states. Such a "quantum bit" allows for far greater flexibility than the binary system. The classic way to demonstrate quantum mechanics is by shining a light through a barrier with two slits. Some light goes through the top slit, some the bottom, and the light waves knock into each other to create an interference pattern.

Question: what is modern psychology
Answer:  Modern psychology is divided into several subdisciplines, each based on differing models of behavior and mental processes. Psychologists work in a number of different settings, including universities and colleges, primary and secondary schools, government agencies, private industry, hospitals, clinics, and private practices. Recent years have seen a rise in the significance of applied psychology—as can be seen from the areas contemporary psychologists concern themselves with—with an attendant decline in the importance of psychology in academia. In the United States, clinical psychology has become a significant focus of the discipline, largely separate from psychological research. Clinical psychologists are responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of various psychological problems. Dr. Paul W. Leithart has written: “All traditional psychiatry rests on two errors: 1) The acceptance of evolution; 2) Secular humanism” (8).

Question: how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop?
Answer:  Tootsie Roll Industries shares on their official website that an engineering student at the University of Michigan invented their own licking machine. A group of middle school students went for a more traditional approach of just licking Tootsie Pops, and managed to get to the center with an impressive 144 licks. The debate was recently reignited on Reddit, when one user shared the results of the Perdue University study. User UnstuckTimePilgrim responded that they conducted their own lick test as a kid, and it took 1,150 licks to reach the center. Other users on the thread shared similar results, with lick counts ranging from 1,012 to a high of 1,436. However, user Freeman7-13 said that in a Tootsie Pop science experiment at their school it took only 800 licks. It seems even after half a century we're no closer to agreeing on how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop. Several users on this Reddit thread do agree about one thing though: To feeling very frustrated with Mr. Owl in the Tootsie Pop ad (shared on YouTube) — for falsely claiming that it only takes three licks, and for stealing that child's lollipop! Yet another study by the University of Michigan concluded that it takes 411 licks to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop.

Question: masters in league of legends
Answer:  Last September, Riot Games announced Toronto-based entertainment company Spin Master, as the official master toy licensee for League of Legends. Since then, Spin Master has been developing a range of collectible action figures to be released this fall. “Spin Master is excited to collaborate with Riot Games to bring innovation and meticulous attention to detail to the rich characters and unique worlds in League of Legends,” said John Blaney, Spin Master’s Senior Vice President of Licensing. “Our League of Legends lineup will appeal to fans of all ages, delivering high-quality products on the cutting edge. The League of Legends Master Series (LMS) was a professional League of Legends league with teams from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau from 2015 to 2019. Eight teams competed over two seasons to qualify for the League of Legends World Championship.

Question: climb ranked games in league of legends
Answer:  A ranked game in League of Legends is a competitive game against other players, only available to summoners who are level 30 and have at least 16 champions. At the start of every season, the ranked ladder is reset and players are required to play 10 “placement” games which determine their initial rank. Once these matches are complete, the player will be placed in a particular tier, which every player can view. If a player is inactive for a certain amount of time or loses several games, then slowly they will be demoted to a lower tier. Players new to LoL’s ranked mode were placed based on normal match performance. Perhaps the most significant change was the removal of “inter-division” promotion series, which were a massive cause of frustration for ranked players.

Question: Was the new Beatles documentary good?
Answer:  Director Peter Jackson’s new three-part, eight-hour documentary, “The Beatles: Get Back,” airing on Disney+ starting Thursday, adds even more obsessive and exhausting detail to the history of a band that has been obsessively documented for more than 50 years. And like the Beatles themselves, by the time the final episode drags itself to a close, viewers are likely to be ready, finally, to quit. At the beginning of 1969, the Beatles were in crisis. Their manager, Brian Epstein (whom they still referred to as “Mr. Epstein”), had died. No one else was in a position to say “no” to any of the four most successful musicians on Earth. In a desperate bid to recapture their former collaborative spark, Paul McCartney suggested a practice session workshopping new songs without studio trickery or overdubs, so the tracks would sound and be reproducible live, as on their early albums. The chemistry and magic between them is so powerful that seeing it end made me wish that much more they could have gone on forever.

Question: How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop?
Answer:  Tootsie Roll Industries shares on their official website that an engineering student at the University of Michigan invented their own licking machine. That contraption came up with a higher number: 411 licks to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop. Other users on the thread shared similar results, with lick counts ranging from 1,012 to a high of 1,436. However, user Freeman7-13 said that in a Tootsie Pop science experiment at their school it took only 800 licks. It seems even after half a century we're no closer to agreeing on how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop. Several users on this Reddit thread do agree about one thing though: To feeling very frustrated with Mr. Owl in the Tootsie Pop ad (shared on YouTube) — for falsely claiming that it only takes three licks, and for stealing that child's lollipop! developed at Purdue University took an average of 364 licks to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop. At the same institution, 20 individuals conducted the same experiment and averaged 252 licks to complete the task. Another licking machine, developed at the University of Michigan required 411 licks to reach the center of a Tootsie Pop; and a group of high school students from Swarthmore Schools averaged 144 licks to achieve the goal So, to answer your question: Getting to the center of a Tootsie Pop takes between 144 to 411 licks, depending on whether you are a teenager or a licking machine.

Question: Will airport x ray machines expose my film?
Answer:  From the TSA:Most x-ray machines used to screen carry-on bags should not damage undeveloped film under ASA\ISO 800. There are a limited number of screening checkpoints that use x-ray equipment that may damage undeveloped film. These airports will have signage in front of the x-ray stating that the x-ray may damage undeveloped film.If you are traveling with the following types of film, please pack it in a clear plastic bag, remove it from your carry-on bag at the checkpoint, and ask for a hand inspection:Film with an ASA\ISO 800 or higherHighly sensitive x-ray or scientific filmsFilm that is or will be underexposedFilm that you intend to “push process”Sheet filmLarge format filmMedical filmScientific filmMotion picture filmProfessional grade filmFilm of any speed that is subjected to x-ray screening more than five timesIn most cases, the x-ray equipment used for screening checked baggage will damage undeveloped film; therefore, please place undeveloped film in carry-on bags. The TSA states that film less than 800 ISO can go through the x-ray machine for carry-ons without a problem. However, Richard suggests you pack your film in a clear plastic bag, remove it from your carry-on bag at the security checkpoint, and (politely) insist that it be hand-searched when carrying any film just to be extra diligent. (Regulations and inspections vary by country, so it is possible some international airports will not honor this request.)

Question: how do you package files in after effects
Answer:  Create a folder (After Effects Templates) and put it in a location that’s easy for you to remember. You can add it to After Effects program file folders, documents, or even your desktop. After Effects templates can help speed up projects and save time if you use the same motion graphics over and over. Note: (Mac OS) Some third-party plug-in installers incorrectly install their plug-ins into the Mac OS X Package for After Effects. To reveal these plug-ins, Control-click the After Effects application icon in the Finder and choose Show Package Contents. You can then move the plug-ins into the After Effects Plug-ins folder.

Question: What is body tuning?
Answer:  Body Tuning is the name I have given to what I do as a physical therapist. Because I have been involved with music and musicians over many years it has made me realize how much physical therapy is like tuning a beautiful instrument. For instance: a piano tuner comes with his bag of tools, but before he begins to work on the piano he asks the owner of the piano what she or he hears from the instrument that does not seem quite right. Then he sets out to discover on his own what the problems are. He plays, he looks at the strings, he tests, and with his various tools he tries to make the piano sing again, thereby making the owner extremely happy.

Question: disease transmitted by gunie pig
Answer:  These bacteria can cause sudden illness in previously healthy guinea pigs when they become stressed or stop eating; this can lead to death. One guinea pig can infect another by direct contact or by sneezing or coughing. As well as predisposing the guinea pig to skin problems, a lack of vitamin C makes the body more prone to the development of other diseases, including infections. Parasites and Skin ProblemsGuinea pigs (especially young ones) are prone to ringworm, which is an infection of the skin with a fungus, not with a worm.

Question: What is a Solomon four group test?
Answer:  A Solomon four-group design is an experimental design method that avoids some of the difficulties of pre-test/post-test design. This testing method involves four test groups, each of which is assigned to be exposed to different components of the testing process. This is used to ensure that no individual component of the testing process has an influence on the results of the testing. The Solomon four-group design is a research method developed by Richard Solomon in 1949. It is sometimes used in social science, psychology and medicine. It can be used if there are concerns that the treatment might be sensitized by the pre-test. The four groups have four different experiences: Pre-test, treatment, post-test Pre-test, no treatment, post-test Treatment, post-test No treatment, post-test The effectiveness of the treatment can be evaluated by comparisons between groups 1 and 3 and between groups 2 and 4. Various statistical treatments for the Solomon four-group design have been put forward, including Stouffer's Z and Monte Carlo.

Question: Explain “Normal Distribution.”
Answer:  Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. In graph form, normal distribution will appear as a bell curve. It has zero skew and a kurtosis of 3.Normal distributions are symmetrical, but not all symmetrical distributions are normal.In reality, most pricing distributions are not perfectly normal. Sometimes it is also called a bell curve. A large number of random variables are either nearly or exactly represented by the normal distribution, in every physical science and economics. Furthermore, it can be used to approximate other probability distributions, therefore supporting the usage of the word ‘normal ‘as in about the one, mostly used.

Question: what are the 5 R's
Answer:  Usually we put recycling on top of everything, but today on the 5 R process, it comes in last. These R’s include: refuse, reduce, reuse, repurpose and finally, recycle. This is an important methodology for businesses to follow to ensure they can reduce waste and boost their recycling efforts. The five rights are a traditional formula expressing the basic objectives of procurement, and the general criteria by which procurement performance is measured. Even if they are not called ‘five rights’, they are often covered in procurement literature as "key performance variables" or "procurement factors"; essentially, we are all talking about the same thing. This ultimately lessens the amount of waste that will end up in landfill and will optimise your recycling programs.

Question: what is text rank algorithm
Answer:  Text rank is a graph based ranking algorithm for natural language processing. It is an extractive and unsupervised approach for text summarization. It uses similarity matrix to determine the similarity between the texts and graphically ranks the texts using the page rank algorithm. The similarity matrix is used to graph the texts where the vertices are the texts and the edges are the connection between the texts which are weighted with the similarity between them. The algorithm is inspired by PageRank which was used by Google to rank websites. The rank of  is defined as: where d is a damping factor between 0 and 1. In the case of text, the connections can be weighted so we introduce  which is the weight of the edge between entity  and . The weighed rank of  now becomes:

Question: what is masculanity
Answer:  The study of masculinity and femininity provides one method for investigating the underlying sociocultural context of the ideal body image. These constructs reflect stereotypes about the beliefs and behaviors typically attributed to males and females, which are acquired as they learn about the world and their roles in it. They also contain social norms that “prescribe and proscribe what males and females should feel and do.” The Western cultural view of masculinity and the masculine gender roles prescribed for males are very clear. Males need to be powerful, strong, and efficacious. These include athletic strength and superiority, competitiveness, toughness, endurance, leadership, status, power, and authority. Masculinity is, therefore, a social construction distinct from male biological sex. Definitions of masculinity vary across different cultures and historical periods.

Question: how to become successful
Answer:  For example when preparing for the Olympics, there is a lot of hard work behind the scenes, consisting of months and even years and years of training and practicing. While those material images of success might be what you think about when you picture a successful person, accolades and money aren’t enough for most people to actually become successful. But there are many different types of motivation—and they’re not all created equal. One of the key motivational dichotomies to think about when it comes to success is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation

Question: what is sous chef
Answer: A Sous Chef, or Second Chef, is responsible for providing supportive leadership to kitchen staff throughout food service. and others employed in the kitchen. The sous chef is often responsible for supervising all of the lower-level employees, before, during, and after food service. In some cases, this can include taking disciplinary actions against those employees who fail to perform up to expectations. Their duties include assisting the Head Chef in monitoring kitchen activities, expediting orders to ensure quality taste or presentation and taking on additional responsibilities in the Head Chef’s absence to ensure that kitchen staff has proper direction.
------------------------------
Question: what is sous chef
Answer: As the chef's primary assistant, the sous chef is expected to take on a lot of responsibility in the kitchen and is the liaison between the executive chef and the rest of the kitchen staff. This includes directing the line cooks, prep cooks.

Question: How block chain works
Answer: The blockchain is a chain of blocks that holds some data with some metadata related to the other blocks that form a giant chain-like architecture that allows encryption in the form of a cryptographic manner. Every block contains a hash that will link to the previous block with data and timestamp details. A Japanese named Satoshi Nakamoto invented Blockchain technology in the year 2008. It was used to serve as a ledger in the form of a bitcoin public ledger. The blockchain invention made the successful entry of a new currency called bitcoin currency which led to the safe and secure form of currency transactions without any validation or authentication through a central server. Each header contains a hash that points to another block’s header to form a chain-like structure.
------------------------------
Question: Applications of blockchain
Answer:  One of the most surprising applications for blockchain can be in the form of improving government. As mentioned previously, some state governments like Illinois are already using the technology to secure government documents, but blockchain can also improve bureaucratic efficiency, accountability and reduce massive financial burdens. Blockchain has the potential to cut through millions of hours of red tape every year, hold public officials accountable through smart contracts and provide transparency by recording a public record of all activity, according to the New York Times. The early internet dealt with intangibles. You sent or received emails, corresponded on forums, read and distributed articles. This modern internet deals with assets, your most valuable immediate items that you can touch and want to protect. These assets are stored in encoded form on a network-to-network chain called the blockchain or ledger, where each participant sees who you do business with. This not only protects your business dealings and prevents theft, but, also, simplifies your affairs, quickens the process, reduces errors, and saves you from hiring a third party.
------------------------------
Question: block chain use cases in supply chain
Answer:  Distributed Ledger Technology solutions that use blockchain in the supply chain enable worldwide trading partners to interact securely and with consensus over shared facts, increasing efficiency, transparency, and visibility. Immutability into the provenance of commodities, the elimination of reconciliation burden across numerous parties, real-time visibility to do track and trace analysis, identify risks, and expedite physical and financial supply chains are examples of blockchain use cases for supply chains. Although supply chain blockchain implementations are still scarce, a growing number of many more supply chain management use cases for blockchain are being explored, including: With so many go-betweens and so much back and forth between partners, friction is a key issue in modern supply chains. As a result, suppliers, providers, and customers interact through third-party businesses rather than dealing directly with each other. In supply chain logistics, blockchain promises that transactions may be verified, documented, and coordinated autonomously without the involvement of third parties. This removes an entire layer of complexity from global supply chains. The use cases for using blockchain in complex supply chain scenarios are growing every day. There will be increased demand for those with blockchain expertise in the real world who can readily build blockchain networks, deploy smart contracts, and ensure the safety and efficiency of their companies’ manufacturing and distribution capabilities.

Question: who developed the theories of the mau mau rebellion
Answer:  Because many loyalists were well-known as such in their communities, the Mau Mau were able to surgically target pro-British elements. The British reasoned that they could end the rebellion by cutting the Mau Mau off from their suppliers. Those who were not Kikuyu were permitted to return to the city. The Mau Mau Rebellion, or the Kenya Emergency, ended in 1960, some time after the capture of Dedan Kimathi and the effective end of operations. The autobiographical material written by Karari Njama (a senior leader in the Mau Mau hierarchy) and compiled by Donald L. Barnett was first published by Monthly Review Press in 1966, as Mau Mau From Within: An analysis of Kenya’s Peasant Revolt. It was reprinted in 1970; it has remained out of print for many years. For so long as the experiences arising from the struggles described in this book are perceived as merely ‘African’ or ‘Kenyan’, it is not possible to fully grasp the contributions they have made to the struggle for a universalist humanity.
------------------------------
Question: what were the goals of the mau mau rebellion
Answer:  The Mau Mau was a secret society (mostly made of Kenyan Farmers) that was forced out of highlands by the British. The goal of the Mau Mau was to eliminate the white farmers into leaving the highlands. The state of emergency in Kenya which had lasted from 1952-1959, probably the longest in the history of Kenya, came to an end. Issues like the expulsion of Kikuyu tenants from settler farms, loss of land to white settlers, poverty, and lack of true political representation for Africans provided the impetus for the revolt. During the eight-year uprising, 32 white settlers and about 200 British police and army soldiers were killed. Legacy and Aftermath Many argue that the Mau Mau uprising helped catalyze decolonization as it showed that colonial control could only be maintained through the use of extreme force.
------------------------------
Question: what is the long term impact of the mau  mau rebellion
Answer:  The Effect of the Mau Mau on the Independence Struggle Despite the defeat of the Mau Mau, the uprising had put Kenya on an inevitable path to independence from colonial rule. Consequently, the effective resistance to colonial rule shown by the Mau Mau accelerated the pace of nationalism in Kenya and throughout East Africa. [xx] The actions of the white settler community had demonstrated how fearful they were of indigenous opposition to their land seizures, and divisions emerged between extremists and moderates, weakening the political domination the community previously enjoyed. The British were forced to spend a tremendous amount of money to combat the rebels, and with the lacklustre British economy still suffering from the effects of the Second World War, this expenditure doubtless sapped the British will to continue maintaining their colonial ambitions in the face of such determined opposition. In addition, the organised approach taken by the Mau Mau and the difficulties they posed for British troops challenged European assertions that Kenyan nationalists were incapable of effectively challenging colonial rule. Economic deprivation continued throughout colonial rule; by 1948, 1.25 million Kikuyu were restricted to 2000 square miles whilst 30,000 white settlers occupied 12,000 square miles, demonstrating the extent to which the Kikuyu were disadvantaged by the white settlers, causing them anger and resentment. As a result to these poor living conditions, there was a huge increase in the number of Kikuyu migrating to the cities; leading to poverty, unemployment and overpopulation. Claude Welch has claimed that grievances were expressed primarily on a tribal basis as opposed to a class basis, which he uses as evidence to suggest that economic deprivation is not as significant a factor as one might believe. However, regardless of whether or not it contributed greatly to the break out of the Mau Mau rebellion, there is little doubt that the unrest caused by economic deprivation had an impact on the Kikuyu, and trough this contributed to the Mau Mau rebellion.

Question: what is the cause for stock market fluctuations
Answer:  It’s easy to imagine that the stock or company itself will cause its price to rise. But stock prices do not move on their own accord. They move solely because of the actions of other market participants. Stock market fluctuations are all caused by people, or algorithms programmed by people, buying and selling stocks.

The price of a stock is still ultimately determined by investors deciding the price at which they will buy or sell it. The price-earnings ratio, commonly referred to as the PE ratio, refers to a stock's market price compared to its earnings per share.

Question: Data Aggregation
Answer:  When data is aggregated, atomic data rows -- typically gathered from multiple sources -- are replaced with totals or summary statistics. Groups of observed aggregates are replaced with summary statistics based on those observations. Data aggregation is a type of data and information mining process where data is searched, gathered and presented in a report-based, summarized format to achieve specific business objectives or processes and/or conduct human analysis. Aggregation is often done on a large scale, through software tools known as data aggregators. Data aggregators typically include features for collecting, processing and presenting aggregate data. Data aggregation is a component of business intelligence (BI) solutions.

Question: blockchain applications in supply chain
Answer:  The project is aimed at providing value to every stakeholder in the supply chain, be it suppliers, retailers, producers or transporters. The project is still awaiting regulatory approval but is certainly a step in the right direction when it comes to blockchain applications in supply chain management. Master the Technology of the Future – BlockchainIt is clear that blockchain applications in the supply chain can result in benefits, and even though it is still in its initial stages, the potential for supply chain revolution is huge.If you’re interested to become a blockchain developer and build smart contracts and chain codes, checkout IIIT-B & upGrad’s Advanced certificate program in blockchain technology.Master the Technology of the Future - Blockchain Apply Now for Executive Certification in Blockchain from IIITB It is clear that blockchain applications in the supply chain can result in benefits, and even though it is still in its initial stages, the potential for supply chain revolution is huge. IBM experimented with integrating blockchain into the coffee supply chain. A new application called “Thank My Farmer” is being developed which allows the coffee drinker to trace back the coffee to the farmers who grew it. It also establishes a direct connection to the farmer and people can extend their support. This application also makes a connection between farmers, traders, roasters, and brands. The blockchain technology brings all parties in the coffee supply chain together, simplifying the exchange and tracking of information and payments, hence providing more trust. This IBM coffee supply chain project application paves the way for the global supply chains to see new dawn comprising of enhanced traceability and trust.

Question: What does Turing test mean?
Answer:  Turing test The Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of an actual human. In the original illustrative example, a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with a human and a machine designed to generate performance indistinguishable from that of a human being. The test does not check the ability to give the correct answer; it checks how closely the answer resembles typical human answers. The test was introduced by Alan Turing in his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," which opens with the words: "I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'" The basic concept behind the test is that if a human judge is engaged in a natural language conversation with a computer where he cannot reliably distinguish machine from human, the machine passes the test. Responses from both participants in the conversation are received in the form of a text-only channel. This test was introduced by Alan Turing in 1950.

Question: Define rational agent.
Answer:  A rational agent or rational being is a person or entity that always aims to perform optimal actions based on given premises and information. In reference to economics, rational agent refers to hypothetical consumers and how they make decisions in a free market. This concept is one of the assumptions made in neoclassical economic theory. The concept of rational agents can be found in various disciplines such as artificial intelligence, cognitive science, decision theory, economics, ethics, game theory, and the study of practical reason.

Question: What is Constraint satisfaction problems?
Answer:  A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a problem that requires its solution within some limitations or conditions also known as constraints. It consists of the following: A finite set of variables which stores the solution (V = {V1, V2, V3,....., Vn}) A set of discrete values known as domain from which the solution is picked (D = {D1, D2, D3,.....,Dn}) A finite set of constraints (C = {C1, C2, C3,......, Cn})  A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a problem that requires its solution to be within some limitations or conditions, also known as constraints, consisting of a finite variable set, a domain set and a finite constraint set. Some of the popular CSP problems include Sudoku, Cryptarithmetic, crosswords, n-Queen, etc.
------------------------------
Question: what is constraint satisfaction problem
Answer: Examples of problems that can be modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem include:  A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a problem that requires its solution within some limitations or conditions also known as constraints. CSPs are the subject of research in both artificial intelligence and operations research, since the regularity in their formulation provides a common basis to analyze and solve problems of many seemingly unrelated families. CSPs often exhibit high complexity, requiring a combination of heuristics and combinatorial search methods to be solved in a reasonable time. Constraint programming (CP) is the field of research that specifically focuses on tackling these kinds of problems. Additionally, Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), the satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), mixed integer programming (MIP) and answer set programming (ASP) are all fields of research focusing on the resolution of particular forms of the constraint satisfaction problem. It consists of the following: A finite set of variables which stores the solution (V = {V1, V2, V3,....., Vn}) A set of discrete values known as domain from which the solution is picked (D = {D1, D2, D3,.....,Dn}) A finite set of constraints (C = {C1, C2, C3,......, Cn})

Question: what is cryptology
Answer:  Cryptography, or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: ???????, romanized: kryptós "hidden, secret"; and ??????? graphein, "to write", or -????? -logia, "study", respectively), is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, communication science, and physics. Applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications. It encompasses both cryptography and cryptanalysis. The term cryptology is derived from the Greek kryptós (“hidden”) and lógos (“word”).

Question: Define DOS.
Answer:  Short for disk operating system, DOS refers to the original operating system developed by Microsoft for IBM, sometimes also referred to as MS-DOS (Microsoft disk operating system). Once the standard operating system for IBM-compatible PCs, DOS started to decline with the rise of Microsoft Windows.
------------------------------
Question: Explain why RSA is used in shared secret key exchange algorithms.
Answer:  RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. It is also one of the oldest. In a public-key cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key, which is kept secret (private). The prime numbers are kept secret. The security of RSA relies on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the "factoring problem". In practice, Diffie–Hellman is not used in this way, with RSA being the dominant public key algorithm. This is largely for historical and commercial reasons,[citation needed] namely that RSA Security created a certificate authority for key signing that became Verisign. Diffie–Hellman, as elaborated above, cannot directly be used to sign certificates. However, the ElGamal and DSA signature algorithms are mathematically related to it, as well as MQV, STS and the IKE component of the IPsec protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol communications.
------------------------------
Question: Discuss the chosen ciphertext problem. Why are good algorithms designed looking at this problem?
Answer:  Chosen-Ciphertext Attack. For other ciphers the answer is no because the number of ciphertexts you would have to send to the oracle is similar to the number of guesses to brute-force the key, so the oracle is not actually saving you any time. Because an attacker can obtain the public keys of people communicating, public key cryptography can always be analyzed with respect to chosen plaintext attacks. That is, an attacker can pick whatever plaintext they want, and encrypt it using the intercepted public key to perform analysis on the resulting ciphertext. This information is then used to try to uncover plaintext from real intercepted ciphertext. If an attacker can replace the receiver's public key in a public database (or other means) with her own and the sender does not verify that he is in fact using the correct public key, the sender will mistakenly encrypt the message with the attacker's public key and the attacker will be able to decrypt the message RSA is a public key algorithm that was created by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. 4,405,829), granted in September 1983, expired in September 2000, so the algorithm is now freely available to use To create an RSA key pair, two large random prime numbers p and q of similar size must be generated.Multiply p and q to form n (n = pq). The values n and e are the RSA public key, and the value d is the RSA private key To encrypt data using the RSA algorithm, the following formula is applied, where m is the plaintext message and c is the resulting ciphertext: c=me mod n. To decrypt data, the following formula is applied:m=cd mod n.

Question: How did the revolution end
Answer:  The American Revolution officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on Sept. 3, 1783. The hostile phase of the war had ended nearly two years earlier, on Oct. 19, 1781, when the British general Charles Cornwallis surrendered to George Washington at Yorktown. Pinned down on the Yorktown Peninsula by George Washington’s troops on the land and a French fleet on the ocean, Lord Charles Cornwallis had no choice but to surrender his entire army, effectively ending the hostile phase of the war. However, the possibility of further battles remained. British troops still held the important port cities of New York City, Savannah and Charleston, and the British Navy remained a formidable force. On the American side, finances were running low, and some unpaid soldiers were even threatening mutiny. This event is sometimes believed to be the end of the revolution because his new position was almost monarchical in its dimensions and certainly represented a break with the careful checks, balances, and elected positions desired by earlier reformers.

Question: Set of all strings that begin and end with different symbols, over ?={a,b}.
Answer:  For a DFA to be valid, there must a transition rule defined for each symbol of the input set at every state to a valid state.DFA Machine that accepts all strings that start and end with same character For the above problem statement, we must first build a DFA machine. DFA machine corresponding to the above problem is shown below, Q1 and Q3 are the final states: How does this DFA Machine works: The working of the machine depends on whether the first character is ‘a’ or ‘b’. So it moves to state Q2.Here, if it gets an ‘a’, it again enters the final state Q1 else for consecutive ‘b’s, it keeps circling.Case 2: String starts with ‘b’ Suppose the first character in the input string is ‘b’, then on reading ‘b’, the control will shift to the upper branch of the machine.Now, it is defined at the string must end with an ‘b’ to be accepted.At state Q3, if again ‘b’ comes, it keeps circling at the same state because for the machine the last read character might be the last character of the string.If it gets a ‘a’, then it has to leave the final state since a string ending in ‘a’ is not acceptable. So it moves to state Q4.Here, if it gets an ‘b’, it again enters the final state Q3 else for consecutive ‘a’s, it keeps circling.Approach for designing the DFA machine:  Define the minimum number of states required to make the state diagram.

Question: Regular expression for Set of all strings that begin and end with different symbols, over ?={a,b}.
Answer:  (D) The set of all strings that begin and end with either 0 or 1.Solution : Option A says that it must have substring 00. But But S -> bS => b is also a part of language. So (B) is not correct.Option (C) says either it will have 0 or more a’s or 0 or more b’s or a’s followed by b’s. A regular expression for ending with abb A regular expression for all strings having 010 or 101. Regular Expression of starting with 0 and having multiple even 1’s or no 1. Question 4 : The regular expression for the language having input alphabets a and b, in which two a’s do not come together:(A) (b + ab)* + (b +ab)*a(B) a(b + ba)* + (b + ba)*(C) both options (A) and (B)(D) none of the aboveSolution:Option (C) stating both both options (A) and (B) is the correct regular expression for the stated question.The language in the question can be expressed as L={?,a,b,bb,ab,aba,ba,bab,baba,abab,…}.In option (A) ‘ab’ is considered the building block for finding out the required regular expression.

Question: What is Closure of an Item set?
Answer:  These examples show that the closure of a set depends upon the topology of the underlying space. In any discrete space, since every set is closed (and also open), every set is equal to its closure. {\displaystyle X,} {\displaystyle X} itself, we have that the closure of the empty set is the empty set, and for every non-empty subset {\displaystyle \operatorname {cl} _{X}A=X.} The closure property means that a set is closed for some mathematical operation. ], is closed with respect to addition because the sum of any two of them is another even natural number, which is also a member of the set.

Question: Write an algorithm to compute the closure set of an Item associated with Shift- Reduce parser.
Answer:  For solving questions in GATE we have to construct the GOTO directly for the given grammar to save time.LR(0) ParserWe need two functions –Closure()Goto()Augmented GrammarIf G is a grammar with start symbol S then G’, the augmented grammar for G, is the grammar with new start symbol S’ and a production S’ -> S. The purpose of this new starting production is to indicate to the parser when it should stop parsing and announce acceptance of input.Let a grammar be S -> AAA -> aA | bThe augmented grammar for the above grammar will beS’ -> SS -> AAA -> aA | bLR(0) ItemsAn LR(0) is the item of a grammar G is a production of G with a dot at some position in the right side.S -> ABC yields four itemsS -> .ABCS -> A.BCS -> AB.CS -> ABC.The production A -> ? generates only one item A -> .?Closure Operation:If I is a set of items for a grammar G, then closure(I) is the set of items constructed from I by the two rules:Initially every item in I is added to closure(I).If A -> ?.B? is in closure(I) and B -> ? is a production then add the item B -> .? to I, If it is not already there. The value of ACTION[i, a] can have one of four forms:Shift j, where j is a state.Reduce A -> ?.AcceptErrorWe extend the GOTO function, defined on sets of items, to states: if GOTO[Ii , A] = Ij then GOTO also maps a state i and a nonterminal A to state j.Eg:Consider the grammar S ->AAA -> aA | bAugmented grammar S’ -> SS -> AAA -> aA | bThe LR(0) parsing table for above GOTO graph will be –Action part of the table contains all the terminals of the grammar whereas the goto part contains all the nonterminals.

Question: community work performed by fraternities and sororities at the University of Kansas
Answer:  Two fraternities at the University of Kansas have been suspended from campus for five years amid allegations that pledges were forced to sleep in vomit-filled beds and were held down and spit upon, among other charges. A university spokesman confirmed Tuesday evening that KU administrators sanctioned the Phi Gamma Delta and Phi Delta Theta fraternities after separate investigations determined both fraternities engaged in hazing activities that caused physical and mental harm to pledges. University of Kansas Graduate Student Body President Hollie Hall said she agrees with the university’s decision to ban these two fraternities. “I don’t think these behaviors are welcome on our campus, I don’t agree with sayings like boys will be boys that are kind of used to say these behaviors are okay, they’re not,” Hall said.

Question: What is Ark Survival Evolved
Answer:  Ark: Survival Evolved is an action-adventure survival game that uses a first-person perspective, with the ability to use a third-person perspective in some instances. The game’s map, known as the “Ark”, is approximately 48 square kilometers in size; there is approximately 36 square kilometers of land mass, with 12 square kilometers of ocean. To build a base, players must gain structure components—such as floors, doors and windows—which are earned as they progress and gain levels. Players can also craft items in the game, such as weapons, which can be achieved by collecting the resources and technology required for crafting. In addition, players can craft and attach accessories to their weapons, such as a scope or flashlight for a pistol or machine gun. Ark: Survival Evolved received generally mixed reviews, with criticism for its "punishing" difficulty, reliance on grinding, and performance issues, particularly on the Nintendo Switch version. Several expansions to the game have been released as downloadable content.

Question: What is an LSP-Path?
Answer: The path taken through the MPLS domain by a packet is referred to as a label switched path (LSP). You can set up an LSP using any of the signaling protocols such as LDP, RSVP, or BGP. The path begins at an ingress provider edge (PE) switch, which makes a decision on which label to prefix to a packet based on the appropriate forwarding equivalence class (FEC). FECs are a set of packets that have identical characteristics (they use the same next hop, interface) and are to be forwarded in a similar way. For example, traffic engineering allows the complete path to be stored at all LSRs along the path. This is because the labels swapped at each LSR have only local significance with regard to any two adjacently connected LSRs. Each LSR simply makes a local forwarding decision based on the incoming label of a packet, and switches the packet to a known outgoing label on a different interface. We should note that once the LFIBs have been established on all LSRs along the path of an LSP, the LSP is uniquely associated with the label and interface it is associated with, and therefore it is uniquely associated with a FEC.

Question: Explain GPRS architecture with a block diagram.
Answer:  To allow the GPRS network to provide the packet data capability additional network entities are required to be added to the overall architecture - two of the main entities are the GGSN and SGSN. A packet data network architecture is overlayed or added to the existing GSM architecture to provide the data capability. A number of new elements are needed for the network, but these can operate alongside the existing elements meaning that the GPRS capability is an upgrade to the network and not a completely new network structure. The PCU added to the base station network routed the data according to whether it was packet or circuit switched. These costs are for general maintenance and other operational costs that may be incurred.

Question: Why did the vietnam war started?
Answer:  The United States had provided funding, armaments, and training to South Vietnam’s government and military since Vietnam’s partition into the communist North and the democratic South in 1954. Tensions escalated into armed conflict between the two sides, and in 1961 U.S. President John F. The Paris Peace Accords of January 1973 saw all U.S. forces withdrawn; the Case–Church Amendment, passed by the U.S. Congress on 15 August 1973, officially ended direct U.S. military involvement. The Peace Accords were broken almost immediately, and fighting continued for two more years. Tensions escalated into armed conflict between the two sides, and in 1961 U.S. President John F. In general, historians have identified several different causes of the Vietnam War, including: the spread of communism during the Cold War, American containment, and European imperialism in Vietnam.

Question: is a keto diet good for children
Answer:  The keto diet is used in children and adolescents under close medical supervision mainly to help treat refractory epilepsy and brain cancer. As with any diet that restricts one or more food groups, the keto diet may have certain adverse effects. The risk of side effects increases in children and adolescents, as their growing bodies are more susceptible. The main potential side effects associated with the keto diet in children are (15, 16): dehydrationelectrolyte imbalancedigestive issues, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipationelevated blood cholesterol levelslow blood sugarimpaired growthvitamin and mineral deficiencies  In recent years, interest in the use of the keto diet to help manage certain health conditions in children, including epilepsy and brain cancer, has increased. While the keto diet is relatively safe for adults, this may not be the case for children and teens unless it’s prescribed by a health professional for medical reasons.

Question: Where is vietnam
Answer:  Vietnam is located on the eastern margin of the Indochinese peninsula and occupies about 331,211.6 square kilometers, of which about 25% was under cultivation in 1987. It borders the Gulf of Tonkin, Gulf of Thailand, and Pacific Ocean, along with China, Laos, and Cambodia. The elongated roughly S shaped country has a north-to-south distance of 1,650 km (1,030 mi) and is about 50 km (31 mi) wide at the narrowest point. With a coastline of 3,260 km (2,030 mi), excluding islands, Vietnam claims 12 nautical miles (22.2 km; 13.8 mi) as the limit of its territorial waters, an additional 12 nautical miles (22.2 km; 13.8 mi) as a contiguous customs and security zone. It has an exclusive economic zone of 417,663 km2 (161,261 sq mi) with 200 nautical miles (370.4 km; 230.2 mi). Located at the eastern edge of mainland Southeast Asia, it covers 311,699 square kilometres. With a population of over 96 million, it is the world's fifteenth-most populous country. Its capital is Hanoi and its largest city is Ho Chi Minh City.

Question: What is python?
Answer:  Python is a general-purpose programming language that can be used on any modern computer operating system. It can be used for processing text, numbers, images, scientific data and just about anything else you might save on a computer. It is used daily in the operations of the Google search engine, the video-sharing website YouTube, NASA and the New York Stock Exchange. These are but a few of the places where Python plays important roles in the success of the business, government, and non-profit organizations; there are many others. Python is an interpreted language. This means that it is not converted to computer-readable code before the program is run but at runtime. In the past, this type of language was called a scripting language, intimating its use was for trivial tasks. However, programming languages such as Python have forced a change in that nomenclature. Increasingly, large applications are written almost exclusively in Python. Python is an open-source coding language, meaning it’s free to use and anyone can modify or create extensions for the Python language.

Question: What is docker
Answer:  Docker is an open source software platform to create, deploy and manage virtualized application containers on a common operating system (OS), with an ecosystem of allied tools. Docker container technology debuted in 2013; Docker Inc. was formed to support a commercial edition of container management software and be the principal sponsor of an open source version. Mirantis acquired the Docker Enterprise business in November 2019. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

Question: how is metaverse different from second life
Answer:  The Internet as we know it today is a largely 2D experience that you ‘browse.’ The Metaverse is likely to be a more immersive experience, where you could ‘live’ via a digital avatar. But, the expanse of things one can do will be drastically different and the layer between our online and offline lives will gradually fade away. Also, in the true realisation of the Metaverse, we may have interoperability, which means different platforms will be connected and you can move across them seamlessly. Spectrum: Second Life was almost like a proto-metaverse. The environments that are used by kids, such as Roblox, are very interesting as well but very different in terms of what they offer. If you talk about people wanting to go to a live concert, or wanting to go shopping or something like that, I think Second Life is still US $650 million a year in transactions and a million people using it. But Second Life didn't grow beyond about a million people. It's been growing more with COVID, but as you say, it didn't break out, it didn't become a billion people.

Question: what is the role of blockchain in metaverse
Answer:  In addition to gaming and social media, other aspects like assets, digital identity, decentralized governance, and applications of finance can also be a part of this virtual world. User creation and ownership of valuable items like digital assets and currencies are essential to create a metaverse. Blockchain technology can play a vital role in incepting these into the metaverse. A secure way for displaying the ownership and transferring the digital assets is required in the virtual world. In-game currencies in today’s virtual reality platforms are less secure compared to the blockchain. The effect of NFT metaverse projects would also play a significant role in transforming the identity, social, and community experiences of users in the metaverse.

Question: What is the state of manufacturing the United States relative to the rest of the world?
Answer:  Taken alone, manufacturing in the United States would be the eighth-largest economy in the world. With $2.27 trillion in value added from manufacturing in 2019, only seven other nations (including the U.S.) would rank higher in terms of their GDP. Those other nations with higher GDP in 2019 were (in order) the U.S., China, Japan, Germany, India, the United Kingdom and France. After manufacturing in the U.S., the next five economies would be Italy, Brazil, Canada, Russia and South Korea, in that order. As shown in chart 2, while the Midwest region has experienced a substantial decline in manufacturing since 1990, the relative employment by state has remained somewhat stable. In 1990, Ohio accounted for 20.3 percent of all manufacturing employment in the region, followed by Illinois with 17.6 percent. By 2019, both states experienced the largest declines in share of regional manufacturing employment: –3.2 percentage points and –3.3 percentage points, respectively.

Question: What is Russia's stance on agricultural tariffs between the United States and China?
Answer:  “Given the geopolitical tensions, Russia is a very natural geopolitical partner,” said Andy Mok, a senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing. Initial Western sanctions on Russia have focused on limiting technology exports and imposing financial penalties. For now, U.S. officials have avoided targeting consumer goods, agricultural products and energy, to try to avoid harming ordinary people and further fueling inflation. China is the world’s dominant manufacturer of electronics, machinery and other manufactured goods, and has been supplying them to Russia in exchange for food and energy. A new cornerstone of relations between China and Russia is a statement that some Western officials say is effectively a Sino-Russian nonaggression pact. It was released by Beijing and Moscow on Feb. 4, when Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin met before the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics. The statement said the countries’ friendship “has no bounds.”  The U.S.-China trade war revealed Russia’s eagerness to replace U.S. agriculture exports to China but also highlighted the barriers it faces. “There’s a niche being freed up in China [by the U.S. tariffs] and we can grow into it,” an official in Russia’s Far East told the Wall Street Journal last year.

Question: What is the impact of Peter the Great on modern Russia?
Answer:  He used a system of meritocracy to reform the Russian military and bureaucracy. He established secular schools for the education of noble children. He defeated the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Sweden in important contests to gain access to the Baltic and Black Seas. Peter the Great is known for the reforms and projects which he undertook to westernize Russia from 1696 to 1725. In addition, Peter had military victories over Russia's great rivals: the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Sweden. These victories lead to territorial gains and the creation of the Russian Navy. Peter as a young man became fascinated by Western way of living and begun to mix with people from Western Europe living in Russia mainly for business. Peters reforms in Russia as a Czar was mainly opposed by conservatives and many Russians who were mostly serfs because it contradicted with the traditions of Russia which was backward.

Question: what is dark academia
Answer:  Dark academia is a broader subculture that has taken off specifically on TikTok, with the primary #darkacademia hashtag racking up over one billion views and the #darkacademiaoutfits hashtag being used over 26 million times. If you’re not familiar with commonly associated imagery, think Gothic architecture, candlelit libraries, and dark film photos placed next to handwritten poetry on a vintage table. The dark academia fashion trend pulls directly from this aesthetic, both of which reference everything from Harry Potter to Hellenistic period art, explains stylist Rebecca Dennett. Dark Academia is a subculture dedicated to – and in celebration of – knowledge. It’s inspired by dusty libraries filled with lengthy tomes, stirring poetry read aloud from a lectern or atop a desk (Dead Poets Society is a Dark Academia must-watch), and delicate instruments used to make all manner of mathematical or scientific discoveries. Those who enjoy Dark Academia probably have a lust for learning and a need to further understand the world around them.

Question: How do children learn language?
Answer:  Help your child build their language skills by reading to them often. And of course, keep having child-centric conversations with them as studies show that babies learn language best within a social context. Another way to encourage their communication and social skills is to mimic their noises (such as their babbling) and say them back to them. You can also mirror their facial expressions and describe their actions as well as narrate what is happening around them. When kids start to learn words, they need some time to get to about 100 words and need to have a lot of input to these words to retain them. However, when the vocabulary gets to about 100 words, then it's the vocabulary explosion. Children can learn lots of words everyday and some that they will only hear once. It's called "fast mapping" and it IS amazing: the child needs to perceive the sounds, infer the meaning from the context, reproduce it orally and memorize all of this information.

Question: is satoshi nakamoto a group?
Answer:  Another popular theory explaining the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is that the name represents a group of companies involved in the creation of bitcoin. This theory has been further strengthened by a recent tweet from SpaceX CEO Elon Musk where he appears to hint that the name SATOSHI NAKAMOTO represents four companies – SA from Samsung, TOSHI from  Toshiba, NAKA from Nakamichi and MOTO from Motorola. Satoshi Nakamoto is the most mysterious figure in bitcoin, according to most people. It is uncertain if the name refers to a single individual or a group of people at this time. What is known is that Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a paper in 2008 that catapulted bitcoin development. Nakamoto advocated a decentralised solution to transactions, which led to the development of blockchains. In a blockchain, a transaction's timestamp is appended to the end of previous timestamps depending on proof-of-work, establishing an immutable historical record.
------------------------------
Question: is satoshi nakamoto alive?
Answer:  But certain individuals can defeat human nature and material temptations that us mere mortals would never be able to. It is thus possible that Satoshi Nakamoto has the will power of a Tibetan Munk and has abandoned his claim to billions. It is also possible that he made more money elsewhere, or at least enough to last him a few lifetimes, so he is not willing to move the funds and prove that he is alive. This doesn’t necessarily mean he is dead, but the very fact that we are asking ourselves this question, shows how powerful ambiguity is.
------------------------------
Question: satoshi nakamoto net worth
Answer: The estimated net worth of Satoshi Nakamoto is 1 million Bitcoin (BTC) – approximately $48 Billion USD (as of December 2021). At Bitcoin’s peak of $20,000, Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin holding was worth more than $20 billion. This made him the 48th richest person in the world. His net worth has, however, dropped since then. Satoshi's wallet owns nearly 5% of all the Bitcoin ever mined, but no one has ever processed a transaction through the wallet address. This would make him one of the most wealthy people in the world.
------------------------------
Question: creater of bitcoin
Answer:  Bitcoin was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, and his creation was an innovation that would change the world. He came up with the idea of “Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system” and released the software that supported it on 12 January 2009. The software was open-sourced, meaning it could be used by anyone, anywhere, and it was designed to work without a centralised authority. The idea of a cryptocurrency was first put forward in 2008 by an anonymous author with the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto”, who was likely a person or a group of people who has never been identified. The first bitcoin, the most popular of all cryptocurrencies, was “mined” in 2009 by someone using a piece of code and a digital currency design that had been collectively developed by Nakamoto and others. In 2016, Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright claimed to be the creator of Bitcoin and provided disputed code as proof.
------------------------------
Question: Craig wright satoshi
Answer:  Andrés Rivero said in a statement following the verdict, “The decision reached by the jury today reinforces what we already knew to be the truth: Dr. Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto, the sole creator of Bitcoin and block chain technology,  and  Craig Wright did not form a partnership with David Kleiman to mine Bitcoin. “Thankfully, the jury recognized the overwhelming evidence—that Dr Wright holds 3,208 patents related to Bitcoin and blockchain technology, he has written extensively about Bitcoin and its underlying code, and has restored the original bitcoin protocol in Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV).“  A judge in the ‘Satoshi Nakamoto trial’ has ordered Craig Wright to pay the heirs of Bitcoin co-inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, David Kleiman, the alleged Bitcoin co-inventor, an additional US$43 million in IP damages. The order asked Craig Wright to pay US$43 million in intellectual property theft damages. The figure is in addition to the US$100 million already awarded to Mr. Kleiman, and it represents a longer period of interest accrual.
------------------------------
Question: rumors about satoshi nakamoto
Answer:  Rumors about the true identity of the creator of Bitcoin – Satoshi Nakamoto – have abounded since the creation of Bitcoin. One person that some in the cryptocurrency community claim is behind the Satoshi Nakamoto alias is Russian Prime Minister Vladamir Putin. This rumor first began because Russia was one of the first countries to fully embrace Bitcoin way back in 2017. Putin back in 2017 wanted Russia to become a cryptocurrency hub and have at least one third of all Bitcoin mining done in the country. Online rumors have persistently claimed that Elon Musk is the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, but Musk has always denied those assertions. The identity of the real inventor of Bitcoin remains a mystery almost a decade and a half after the whitepaper on the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency was published.

Question: DARK SIDE OF DOGE COIN
Answer: 
------------------------------
Question: RUMORS ABOUT DOGECOIN
Answer:  Dogecoin is a proof of work (PoW) coin that uses the Scrypt algorithm. Major manufacturers of ASICs include BitMain (AntMiner), Microbt (Whatsminer), and Canaan (AvalonMiner). The official Reddit community (subreddit) for Dogecoin is r/dogecoin. Over the past year well over a hundred new cryptocurrencies have been created but not many have instantly carved out a niche. Dogecoin has sponsored multiple high profile events such as Nascar teams and the winter Olympics - even so, there are few locations to use the coin - and instead, it has become a de facto internet tipping currency. The coin has produced 100 billion units by the end of 2014 and is now producing roughly 5 billion units per year. Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin and other popular cryptocurrencies can be purchased with U.S. dollars using Coinbase or BlockFi.

Question: ELON MUSK AND DOGECOIN
Answer: Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk shared a video about the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) on April 1 in reply to a tweet about bitcoin by Brett Winton, Ark Invest’s director of research. Elon Musk has revealed that Tesla’s upcoming futuristic diner and drive-in theater, planned for the Hollywood area, will accept the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin. The electric car company currently accepts DOGE for some merchandise on its website. Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk tweeted about future dogecoin payment acceptance Friday in reply to a tweet by developer Ryan Zohoury, who said a new Tesla supercharger station in Santa Monica, California, is almost full 10 minutes after it opened.

Question: china on cryptocurrency
Answer:  China said on Friday that all cryptocurrency transactions in the country, including those using Bitcoin, will be declared unlawful by the government. The country asserts that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are not guaranteed by any government or bank and so cannot be used as legal currency in any jurisdiction. The Chinese central bank also said on its website that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Tether are not permitted to be used in the country’s economy. However, it appears that for the time being, owning Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency in China is not prohibited. Only their possession is prohibited. SHANGHAI — China intensified a crackdown on cryptocurrency trading on Friday, vowing to root out "illegal" activity, hitting bitcoin and other major coins and pressuring crypto and blockchain-related stocks. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said cryptocurrencies must not circulate in markets as traditional currencies and that overseas exchanges are barred from providing services to mainland investors via the internet.

Question: China partnership with crypto
Answer:  Two Fintech companies from China and Korea established a Partnership to bring revolution in the blockchain industry through the use of the crypto blockchain network. But still huge efforts of the Chinese authorities can be seen where they are working in the blockchain technology based project to bring a huge revolution in the payment system and blockchain adoption. Red Date Technology is a blockchain based firm in China. Now Red Date is in partnership with the MetaverseSociety Corp. This partnership will allow China & Korea to establish a Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) portal. Shanghai-based firm’s new partnership which will introduce a cryptocurrency solution comes despite China’s own ban on cryptocurrency, initial coin offerings (ICOs) and onshore crypto trading. Meanwhile, China made headlines recently with its news of testing its central bank-backed digital currency, the e-yuan. In fact, the Governor of the central bank of China, Yi Gang, revealed on 2 November that in its CBDC pilot program, the digital yuan has been used in over four million transactions totaling to more than 2 billion yuan (about $299 million) to date.

Question: China crypto 2022 news
Answer:  In a video conference today, the People’s Bank of China has reaffirmed a continued crackdown on virtual currency transactions. In a video conference, the People’s Bank of China said that the crackdown on virtual currency transactions would continue, going ahead in 2022. While before the ban, 90% of worldwide crypto transactions originated from China, the number dropped to 10%, the bank revealed in a video conference. While the overall crypto market capitalization plunged below pre-ban levels, it has remained stable and is unchanged. Bitcoin price suffered a 5% drop in response to the news of a continued ban in China.
------------------------------
Question: Future of crypto china
Answer:  The Chinese government's five-year plan drafted earlier this year for the first time mentioned blockchain, which is the decentralized digital ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Make no mistake about that," Haun said on "Squawk Box," despite its latest crackdown on bitcoin mining and crypto services. However, she stressed that Chinese President Xi Jinping and other officials "are all in on their brand of crypto, which is a closed permission system. Bitcoin on Tuesday fell below $30,000 — and, at one point even further, briefly losing all of its 2021 gains. The world's largest cryptocurrency has recovered somewhat, trading at nearly $34,000 on Thursday. Just earlier this year, China announced more measures to shutdown crypto mining rigs, which process and verify crypto transactions, and reiterated its ban on Chinese financial institutions providing crypto-related services. It doubled down on forcing miners out, and the PBOC said it plans to step up monitoring of crypto-related transactions.

Question: why did el salvador legalize crypto
Answer:  The electric delivery van maker signed a new purchase agreement, had some insider stock-buying, and benefited from a broad market recovery. With costly channels and a lack of infrastructure on the receiving end, the government believes that Bitcoin can provide a better alternative for Salvadorians working abroad to send money back home. In another step to include the cryptocurrency into the economy, the country created its own digital wallet (compatible with the ATMs), called Chivo, and has offered $30 worth of Bitcoin to all citizens who use the new payment system. El Salvador wanted to be the first country to legalize Bitcoin in the hopes that this would boost the economy, encouraging crypto enthusiasts to spend more in the country. This was done in the hopes of stimulating the economy and incentivizing them to try out the country’s new legal tender.
------------------------------
Question: when did el salvador legalize crypto
Answer:  El Salvador’s association with Bitcoin began in 2019 on Bitcoin Beach, in the town of El Zonte. That’s where an evangelical surfer named Mike Peterson teamed up with a local resident, Jorge Valenzuela, to transform the small coastal town into a circular economy built around the cryptocurrency. Seeing potential for a nationwide application, President Bukele announced his Bitcoin Law at a cryptocurrency conference in Miami in June 2021. When El Salvador officially made Bitcoin legal tender in September 2021, José Bonilla was one of the first citizens to sign up for a government-backed digital wallet that lets anyone use the cryptocurrency. The 23-year-old Salvadoran, who runs a shoe store with his family in the tourist town of Concepción de Ataco, was looking forward to trying out the technology.
------------------------------
Question: WILL OTHER COUNTRIES LEGALIZE CRYPTO AS LEGAL TENDER
Answer:  While the number of users is comparatively less in Africa, almost all African countries are open to crypto transactions. Cryptocurrency transactions are not banned in Tanzania. However, the Bank of Tanzania does not favor the use of cryptocurrency. The bank maintains that Tanzanian shilling is the only acceptable legal tender in the country. Mining is considered an “entrepreneurial activity.” Bitcoins are still identified as property and not legal tender. Still, with more and more people entering the market, they will be a legalized tender sooner or later. Jamaica is one of the countries where the country’s bank favors the use of cryptocurrencies. Some like China and Russia, however, are against allowing trading in cryptocurrency.
------------------------------
Question: WHICH COUNTRIES ALLOW CRYPTO TRANSACTIONS
Answer: Over the past few years, cryptocurrency has taken the western world by storm, with the top crypto coins now worth thousands of dollars. But, while the crypto industry may seem like it's booming, a considerable number of countries have banned or highly restricted the use of cryptocurrency. China is a wealthy country that, until recently, had a thriving crypto market. So, which countries are saying no to crypto, and why? However, the Chinese government decided to ban cryptocurrency trading and mining entirely. Since 2013, China has been limiting the use of cryptocurrency via numerous restrictive measures. These measures eventually resulted in a total cryptocurrency ban in September 2021, when the government made crypto mining and crypto transactions illegal.

Question: WHAT IS A CRYPTO WALLET
Answer: A crypto wallet is more or less your identity when you buy Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency: its address is how your buying and selling is recorded on the blockchain (and also the reason these currencies aren’t anonymous). Your cryptocurrency wallet holds a combination of a public wallet address and private security key. If you want to invest in cryptocurrency or non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or use any other blockchain-based service, then you need a cryptocurrency wallet. A crypto wallet is nothing like your regular, real-life wallet. Right now, you could probably reach for your wallet, open it up and either take out physical money or put some back in—or at least some kind of payment card.
------------------------------
Question: HARDWARE CRYPTO WALLET
Answer: A hardware wallet is a crypto wallet that holds the user’s private keys (an essential piece of data necessary to approve outbound transactions on the blockchain network) in a secure hardware device. They can be plugged into a computer, or connected to a mobile device to enable users to manage and spend their crypto, but all aspects of any transactions and validations are done on the device itself. Even if the device being used is infected with malware or is otherwise compromised, the hardware wallet remains secure and nobody else can get access to the private keys. Each of the wallets mentioned here today come with the vitally important feature of being able to back up your wallet so you will be able to restore your wallet, and your funds, should you lose or damage the wallet that stores your private keys so please follow good crypto security etiquette 101 and always ALWAYS be sure to back up any wallet you use, software or hardware. Keeping those recovery seed phrases stored safely will likely be the only way to recover your funds should something go astray with your crypto storage method of choice. The hardware wallets are just little electronic devices comparable to a USB drive or a key fob. They may be used to store private keys, which allow only the owner to access and control their Bitcoin. Users may also have a wallet address, which they may use to receive any cryptocurrency that is delivered to them.
------------------------------
Question: SOFTWARE CRYPTO WALLET
Answer:  Hardware wallets are physical devices that store your cryptocurrency offline. The Ledger Nano X, Trezor Model T and SafePal S1 are popular names in the hardware wallet industry. Software wallets work similarly to hardware wallets, but are typically connected to the internet. A wallet connected to the internet, also known as a hot wallet, is more susceptible to leaking your private key. It is the best choice if you invest significant amounts of money and don’t plan to trade it regularly. Lesser known but still has good ratings. This is a popular multi-currency software crypto wallet for mobile devices. Citowise wallet supports almost 40 cryptocurrencies and is in-built with centralizing input validation to ensure high-level security of users’ data.
------------------------------
Question: SOFTWARE WALLET
Answer:  With desktop, mobile and online software wallets existing, there are even more options to choose from when deciding which software wallet is best for you. Security remains the highest priority for many users, discouraging them from using desktop or online software wallets which remain highly susceptible to hacking when connected to the internet. Another factor to consider when considering software wallets is which coins it is able to store. There are some wallets which store all coins while some are specifically designed for certain coins. Guarda Wallet is a non-custodial, multi-platform software wallet that enables users to manage their digital assets using a web interface, a Chrome extension, on desktop, and on mobile (Android and iOS) while retaining complete control over their private keys.
------------------------------
Question: Advantages of coinbase
Answer:  The main benefit which is a common characteristic to Coinbase and similar sites is that it allows you to use fiat money such as euros and USD to buy different cryptocurrencies. Coinbase Pro is a platform for people who are not new to trading in crypto. Therefore, it has advanced charts that are more detailed hence more informative to ensure the trading decisions you make are informative. It also has charts for trading crypto pairs hence providing more trading options. Coinbase pro supports more than 250 different types of cryptocurrencies, therefore, providing you with more trading options. Coinbase is one of the best overall exchanges for new crypto investors, as well as for institutional traders who want access to high-quality service and a simplified user experience. That being said, Coinbase is not for everyone, and its high fees and limited trading options for advanced users may be restrictive and expensive. Coinbase is also very selective about which coins it lists, which means it may not carry your favorite altcoin or new crypto project.
------------------------------
Question: Mycelium crypto wallet
Answer:  Mycelium has been around since the beginning of the crypto era, and the Mycelium wallet is one of the oldest and best-known bitcoin wallets. This is a mobile-only wallet -- there is currently no desktop version -- that supports both Android and iOS. The Mycelium wallet has an appealingly simple interface but it supports fewer kinds of crypto than others profiled here: You can send and receive bitcoin, ether and ERC-20 tokens such as tether USD, USD coin and binance USD -- but not the hundreds of esoteric coins that have been developed over the past few years. You can buy and sell bitcoin directly in the app, and Mycelium lets you buy bitcoin with regular fiat currency. Mycelium cryptocurrency wallets enable you to store crypto coins by using a hardware wallet like Trezor, KeepKey, and Ledger Nano S. This open-source module offers a secure authentication process instead of a simple password authentication process. These accounts have Bitcoin addresses stored without any corresponding private key. They do not allow the wallet to send out transactions, but users can only watch them for output. This feature is useful for those who want to stock their Mycelium wallets and view their outgoing transactions.

Question: What is ethereum
Answer:  Ethereum is a platform powered by blockchain technology that is best known for its native cryptocurrency, called ether, or ETH, or simply ethereum. Smart contracts, which originated on the Ethereum platform, are a central component of how the platform operates. Many decentralized finance (DeFi) and other applications use smart contracts in conjunction with blockchain technology. As a cryptocurrency, Ethereum is second in market value only to Bitcoin as of January 2022. Each block contains an identifier of the chain that must precede it if the block is to be considered valid. Whenever a node adds a block to its chain, it executes the transactions in the block in the order they are listed, thereby altering the ETH balances and other storage values of Ethereum accounts.

Question: History of Ethereum
Answer:  As a quick recap so far, Ethereum was born in 2014 out of Vitalik Buterin’s White Paper, and the core development team has been extremely successful since the start. By 2016 a critical flaw in the DAO smart contract made it possible for hackers to steal millions of dollars worth of Ethereum, thus posing a serious threat to its survival. From there two protocols were formed, Ethereum Classic (ETC) Containing the unaltered history of the protocol (comprising the stolen tokens) and ETH, which would be rebranded as Ethereum, which contained the altered history (the protocol from which the stolen tokens had been removed). As Ethereum showed its viability, it started to scale quickly and by 2017 it also showed its potential. However, a problem of scalability arose, especially in light of massive “gas fees” (the fees to process transactions on top of Ethereum’s Blockchain). Among all blockchain networks, Ethereum is currently the most popular for developing decentralized applications due to its large community and the number of companies around the world supporting it. Currently, there are more than 200,000 developers building applications on it, and the new One Million Devs initiative is supposed to raise that number even more. The secret lies in the approach of its creators and their goal. Soon he found out that all these projects were very narrow-minded, and there wasn’t any single platform that allowed to build decentralized applications easily.
------------------------------
Question: History of ETH
Answer:  Following the successful ether presale, Ethereum development was formalized under a non-for-profit organization called ETH DEV, which manages the development of Ethereum under contract from Ethereum Suisse – with Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, and Jeffrey Wilcke as the 3 directors of the organization. Developer interest in Ethereum grew steadily throughout 2014 and the ETH DEV team delivered a series of proof-of-concept (PoC) releases for the development community to evaluate. Frequent posts by ETH DEV team on the  the Ethereum blog also kept the excitement and momentum around Ethereum going. Increasing traffic and growing user-base on both the Ethereum forum and the ethereum subreddit testified that the platform is attracting a fast-growing and devoted developer community. This trend has been continuing to this very day. In November 2014, ETH DEV organized the DEVCON-0 event, which brought together Ethereum developers from around the world to Berlin to meet and discuss a diverse range of Ethereum technology topics. Several of the presentations and sessions at DEVcon-0 would later drive important initiatives to make Ethereum more reliable, more secure, and more scalable. Overall, the event galvanized developers as they continued to work towards the launch of Ethereum.

Question: Future of Ethereum
Answer:  Nathan Cox, the representative of Two Prime, said that in the future, Ethereum has a chance of overcoming bitcoin’s popularity. While talking about the possible future of Ethereum, he also noted that while bitcoin is the digital version of gold, Ethereum can be seen as digital oil. In addition, it was also reported a few weeks back that Goldman Sachs was planning to launch futures and options contracts on Ethereum, in addition to the futures of BTC. The head of Goldman Sachs digital assets, Mathew McDermott talked about the adoption of Ethereum derivatives. This could further influence the price changes of Ethereum. Ethereum has the potential to outperform other cryptocurrencies in the future for the following reasons: Projects in the Future: Ethereum allows users to codify, decentralize, secure, and trade on anything. There are a lot of projects that rely on Ethereum.
------------------------------
Question: Ethereum in 2021
Answer:  Ethereum (ETH) scaled the heights in 2021 by generating revenue to the tune of $9.9 billion, thanks to a couple of use cases on its network. The second-largest cryptocurrency also closed 2021 on a high with an annual return rate of 399.2%, according to crypto insight provider CoinGecko. On the other hand, Ethereum’s on-chain volume increased by 36.4% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, topping 2.14 billion ETH. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has said he is considering implementing an emergency measure to bring down the cost of transacting in Ethereum, which would be a welcome development, but aside from this the Ethereum team is fully focused on delivering Ethereum 2.0 in 2022.
------------------------------
Question: Applications of Ethereum
Answer:  These are some of the fields in which its implementations are sought by Ethereum. Compound Finance, Marble, Cryptokittes, CryptoRome, MetaMask, SelfKey and many more are some examples. So, we have Ethereum coming to life, and its applications traverse various fields such as gaming, politics, banking, payment, and others. Ethereum is a blockchain-based computing platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications—meaning not run by a centralized authority. You can create a decentralized application for which the participants of that particular application are the decision-making authority.

Question: Does Tesla accept Crypto in 2022
Answer:  However, during the B Word cryptocurrency conference earlier in 2021, Musk admitted that Tesla would ‘most likely’ resume accepting the digital currency. Many crypto commentators have said it may point to dogecoin (another cryptocurrency) being accepted in the future. Tesla UK has yet to confirm whether Dogecoin will be accepted in the UK in the future. Tesla merch buyable with Dogecoin — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 14, 2022  Billionaire business magnate Elon Musk has made many comments on Bitcoin, crypto in general, and altcoins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. In January 2022 on his Twitter he confirmed that Tesla would accept DOGE as a form of payment for merchandise. However he is yet to tweet about TeslaCoin so it can’t be confirmed that despite the cryptocurrency’s name and apparent link to the Tesla company, whether Elon Musk supports the TeslaCoin project.
------------------------------
Question: Does Tesla accept bitcoin in 2022
Answer:  According to the document, filed in relation to the company’s recent earnings report, Tesla detailed their holding of $1.5 billion USD in Bitcoin and said it might consider accepting cryptocurrency as payment. CEO Elon Musk cited concerns about the environmental impact of mining Bitcoin. “Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at a great cost to the environment.” Last week, the company posted its third-quarter earnings, noting a record net income, operating profit and gross profit, as well as an operating margin that exceeded expectations. Tesla’s total revenue grew 57% year-over-year in Q3 to a record $13.76 billion USD, attributed to a growth in vehicle deliveries as well as growth in other areas of the business. In March 2021, Tesla CEO Elon Musk had announced on Twitter that the carmaker would accept the most popular and largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin as a mode of payment to purchase electric vehicles. Mr Musk cited climate change as the main reason behind the company's decision to discontinue accepting the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin mining has been deemed harmful by environmentalists as the consumption of power and electricity is excessive. These concerns prompted Mr Musk to officially announce Tesla's withdrawal from accepting Bitcoin.

Question: Environmental aspect of cryptocurrency
Answer:  As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the economic impact they have on the world needs to be considered. It’s important for everyone involved in this market to take their responsibility for environmental impact seriously because if not everyone does their part, then it could lead to serious repercussions across the world. The main technological aspect of cryptocurrency is, of course, blockchain. It is in this technology that many believers see the future of technological innovation and economic development. Finance security and decentralisation are some of the core values behind this innovation, and they are also one of the main reasons why people get so invested in blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Blockchain’s environmental impact is clear and quantifiable, but it’s important to consider that it is only a part of cryptocurrency’s overall impact on the environment. However, mine coins require mining which is an energy-intensive process. This means that the environmental impact of cryptocurrency is not as minimalist as it used to be portrayed.
------------------------------
Question: Environmental impact of cryptocurrency
Answer: However, mine coins require mining which is an energy-intensive process. The most obvious environmental impact of crypto is the electricity required for the mining process, which is how new digital coins are created. While most know this as Bitcoin mining, many forms of cryptocurrency rely on mining. This means that the environmental impact of cryptocurrency is not as minimalist as it used to be portrayed. But since Bitcoin’s release, it’s become progressively harder to mint new units of currency through mining. This was by design, as the currency was capped at 21 million units, so the more units minted, the fewer units there are available to mine, and the more computational power it takes to mint new ones.
------------------------------
Question: How is cryptocurrency affecting an environment
Answer:  You may think that cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, is eco-friendly because it’s paper-free, and people don’t use many natural resources to create it. In reality, though, it has a harmful effect on our environment. When mining cryptocurrency, users consume lots of electricity produced from burning fossil fuels, so the crypto creating process increases the emissions of carbon dioxide and worsens air quality, which has a negative influence on the environment. Digiconomist says that the cryptocurrency sphere currently needs more energy than some countries, such as Austria and the Czech Republic, while the size of its carbon footprint can be compared to that of Denmark. Scientist Benjamin Jones says that what makes the research remarkable is the fact that the creation of cryptocurrency is a lot more harmful to the climate and health than most people realize.
------------------------------
Question: India's stand on Cryptocurrency
Answer:  India’s Present Stand On Cryptocurrency Govt’s official notification on the Lok sabha website says that it is set to introduce “The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021? in the winter session of Parliament beginning 29 November for consideration and passing. Thus, the government, as well as central banks, are averse to the idea of crypto. This bill will aim to create a framework for the introduction of India’s official digital currency which will be issued by the Reserve Bank of India. This bill also plans on banning all private crypto currencies in India, with some exemptions solely for technological purposes. However, a point to note is that there are several governments around the world that have either launched their own digital currency or are in the process of bringing it.Precisely why the RBI too is all set to bring its Central bank digital currency soon. So how is the government’s current plan of banning crypto going to affect crypto investors?Advertisement.
------------------------------
Question: digital currency bill 2022
Answer:  Lynch’s bill builds on widespread existing interest in a US “digital dollar.” The Federal Reserve released a preliminary report on digital currency earlier this year, suggesting it could benefit Americans who aren’t served by the current banking system. More recently, the Biden administration included a central bank digital currency (CBDC) as an action item in its cryptocurrency executive order. Many governments outside the US were already exploring digital currencies. Among other initiatives, the European Commission plans to propose a “digital euro” in 2023, and China launched a “digital yuan” pilot program in January. The bill specifies that e-cash is distinct from CBDCs and wouldn’t supplant a potential Federal Reserve program. As CoinTelegraph lays out, there’s no central or distributed ledger that keeps track of transactions. This preserves anonymity, but it also means users’ digital cash would be lost if the device or card holding it goes missing. It would build on existing Treasury cash replacement systems like EagleCash, a digital money storage card for members of the military.

Question: What is digital currency
Answer: Digital currencies exhibit properties similar to other currencies, but do not have a physical form of banknotes and coins. Digital currencies are currencies that are only accessible with computers or mobile phones because they only exist in electronic form.Typical digital currencies do not require intermediaries and are often the cheapest method for trading currencies.All cryptocurrencies are digital currencies, but not all digital currencies are cryptocurrencies.Some of the advantages of digital currencies are that they enable seamless transfer of value and can make transaction costs cheaper. Not having a physical form, they allow for nearly instantaneous transactions. It is also called digital money, electronic money, electronic currency, or cybercash.

Question: What is digital currency
Answer:  Digital Currency is a term that refers to a specific type of electronic currency with specific properties. Digital Currency is also a term used to include the meta-group of sub-types of digital currency, the specific meaning can only be determined within the specific legal or contextual case. Legally and technically, there already are a myriad of legal definitions of digital currency and the many digital currency sub-types. Many governmental jurisdictions have implemented their own unique definition for digital currency, virtual currency, cryptocurrency, e-money, network money, e-cash, and other types of digital currency. The US Department of Treasury in 2013 defined it more tersely as "a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency". Some of the disadvantages of digital currencies are that they can volatile to trade and are susceptible to hacks.

Question: What is cryptocurrency
Answer:  A cryptocurrency is a tradable digital asset or digital form of money, built on blockchain technology that only exists online. There are currently over a thousand different cryptocurrencies in the world. Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Since the release of bitcoin, many other cryptocurrencies have been created. It is designed to work as a medium of exchange, where individual ownership records are stored in a computerised database. The defining trait of a cryptocurrency is that they are not issued by the government agency of any country making them immune against any interference and manipulation from them.

Question: What is deterrence theory of punishment
Answer:  In criminology, deterrence can be defined as the preventive effect which actual or threatened punishment of offenders has upon potential offenders. The very purpose of the selection of this type of punishment on offenders is to deter them from committing a crime. The deterrent theory also seeks to create some kind of fear in the mind of others by providing adequate penalty and exemplary punishment to offenders which keeps them away from criminality. In the case of State Of H.P v. Nirmala Devi6, it was observed that, the purpose of sentencing is that if a particular crime against the society is a heinous crime, then the theory deterrence becomes more relevant as a rationale for punishing the offender. It becomes the duty of the State to punish the offender when the offences against the society. It was further stated that, when it comes to sentencing a person for committing a heinous crime, notwithstanding the other theories of punishment, the deterrence theory is more relevant in terms of a heinous crime as in such cases mercy, compassion and forgiveness becomes secondary.

Question: What is an overview and history of debt diplomacy with China and Africa?
Answer:  The debt diplomacy China has imposed across Africa has particular implications for the United States. China’s rising influence in the region, threatens to diminish US strategic partnerships across the continent. If Djibouti defaults on its loan, the nation’s indebtedness to China could threaten US military capabilities, potentially closing off Lemonnier’s access to a vital port which provides logistical support to US operations across Africa. The sustainability of Africa’s borrowing appears increasingly uncertain and the matter is causing tensions in the political arena. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa pushed back against concerns stating that, “we are very jealous of our assets and will not hand over South Africa to any other country or any other entity.” Meanwhile, in nearby Zambia anxiety over the potential debt trap escalated as rumors circulated that China planned to gain control of Zambian power company, ZESCO, in order to reconcile the nation’s continuous defaults on Chinese loans.v Although unconfirmed, the reports raised public awareness and concern over the risks associated with such ample lending.vi Despite these increasing strains, the attractiveness of loans from China has grown in recent years as monies financed by Western institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, have complex political stipulations which require proper governance, democracy, or human rights guarantees in exchange for aid.

Question: What is an overview and history of debt diplomacy with China and Africa?
Answer:  NEW YORK (IDN) — In mid-December 2021, South African comedian Trevor Noah used “The Daily Show” to target China when he aired a segment titled “Why China Is in Africa”. While this segment was advertised as an informed, nuanced overview of the complex international relationship between China and many African states, it mainly reinforced the debunked myth of “debt-trap diplomacy” to its American audiences, ending with a throwaway line about #StopAsianHate. The myth of “debt-trap diplomacy” claims that China is using its financial resources to ensnare African countries, coercing them to hand over their natural resources at lower prices. In a recent interview with CODEPINK, Mikaela Nhondo Erskog, an educator and researcher, explains why Noah had such a disappointing take: “It was [former U.S. Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo who coined the term, or popularized it, the Chinese ‘debt trap,’ and… it is disappointing that there was no effort to look into the multiple available sources who give extensive detailing of how this is a myth.”  China’s debt diplomacy shuts out opportunities for US and other European nations businesses. Not only do Beijing’s cheap infrastructure loans come with conditions to employ Chinese companies in Africa, they also set out technical specifications for projects like high-speed railways and wireless networks in a manner that favours Chinese firms. The combined effect of these efforts “would push the United States away from its current position in the global economy  and move China toward the centre,” according to Jonathan Hillman, a fellow at the Centre for International and Strategic Studies.

Question: Exim Bank of China effects, salami slicing strategy?
Answer:  China's salami slicing (Chinese: ??; pinyin: Cán shí; transl. "nibbling like a silkworm") refers to a strategy by which the government of China is said to use small provocations, none of which would constitute a casus belli by itself, but cumulatively produce a much larger action or result in China's favor which would have been difficult or unlawful to perform all at once. In the context of China, salami slicing denotes its strategy of territorial expansion in the South China Sea and the Himalayan regions. Many believe that Doklam standoff was the result of China's salami slicing tactics in the Himalayas.

China’s rising influence in the region, threatens to diminish US strategic partnerships across the continent. If Djibouti defaults on its loan, the nation’s indebtedness to China could threaten US military capabilities, potentially closing off Lemonnier’s access to a vital port which provides logistical support to US operations across Africa. In addition to harming the US strategic capabilities, US business opportunities in the region are limited as Chinese development loans stipulate terms that favor Chinese firms.xii  These stipulations increase the risk of Africa’s dependency on China and could have damaging consequences for inter-state competition with China. China’s debt trap diplomacy often binds countries to Beijing’s international vision. In most cases, Chinese officials offer large sums of investment to a country’s powerful elites, who accept the loans to modernize their nation’s infrastructure. Yet the loans are often accompanied by stipulations that require the project to use Chinese construction materials or partner with Chinese companies.

Question: China Africa Research Initiative and debt diplomacy?
Answer:  The China Africa Research Initiative-(CARI) at the Johns Hopkins School of International Studies, Washington DC refuted the “death-trap” narrative that China is subverting African nations by forcing them into debt. To discuss accusations that China engages in so-called “debt trap diplomacy,” Eric and Cobus spoke with Deborah Brautigam, a Johns Hopkins University Professor and Director of the China-Africa Research Initiative in Washington, D.C. There is no evidence China aims to deliberately push poor countries into debt as a way of seizing their assets or gaining a greater say in their internal affairs, researchers and analysts said – countering Washington’s narrative that China was engaging in “debt-trap diplomacy”. Deborah Brautigam, a professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins University and founding director of the China Africa Research Initiative (Cari), considers the “debt-trap” narrative a myth.

Question: How does debt diplomacy and China investment practices affect the achievement of sustainable development goals?
Answer:  China and 27 other countries have jointly adopted the Guiding principles on financing the development of the Belt and Road, which highlights the need to ensure debt sustainability in project financing. The BRI and SDGs definitely need one another for their mutual success, but both require a new development paradigm that not only balances the economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protections but also fits the development context of the developing world. Meanwhile, BRI investors have to ensure that all investments are aligned with the SDGs. Although we’ve seen progress such as the BRI Green Investment Principles, committed by 37 big financial players, more actions have to be sped up, right now. The World Bank estimates that the BRI could increase growth by 3.4% in BRI countries and by 2.9% in the rest of the world. Ex post analyses have already shown that Chinese overseas investment is associated with economic growth. However, there is also a great deal of evidence that BRI projects are associated with relatively more debt distress, social inequity, and carbon dioxide emissions than some of their counterparts, such as the World Bank. In the past few years, China, in crossing the river by touching each stone, has seen the mixed impacts of the BRI and has made steps to devise a new debt sustainability framework and a set of principles to establish social and environmental standards in its BRI lending projects. What is more, as a member of the International Development Finance Club, the China Development Bank (which in many ways is a flagship of the BRI) pledged to align its efforts with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Question: What are arguments and counterarguments for debt diplomacy?
Answer:  Wikipedia describes debt-trap diplomacy as a “situation where a powerful lending country or institution seeks to saddle a borrowing nation with debt to increase its leverage over it.” The term was initially promoted by Brahma Chellaney, an Indian academic, in 2017. By extending extensive credit to the debtor nation, the lending nation purposely leaves the debtor nation challenged or unable to meet debt repayment. It does so with the purpose of extracting economic or political concessions. The term has been applied to the International Monetary Fund, and especially to China and its Belt and Road Initiative. Critics such as Deborah Brautigam of Johns Hopkins University, Lee Jones of the University of London and Shahar Hameiri of the University of Queensland argue that there is scant evidence to support concerns of debt-trap diplomacy. The conventional wisdom, they say, is that China knowingly loaned money to Sri Lanka to build the port, knowing that it would experience debt distress and eventually come to control it.
------------------------------
Question: Belt and Road Initiative and Debt Trap Diplomacy economic strategy
Answer:  First announced by the Chinese government in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI is a key plank of Chinese foreign policy aimed at connecting China to the world via a complex network of roads, ports, and railways. It is also often cited in the West as the leading example of debt-trap diplomacy. The ambitious program spans around 2,600 projects in over 100 countries, all subsidized by Chinese loans. The program includes several initiatives, most notably the Silk Road Economic Belt, encompassing the Eurasian landmass into Europe and Africa, as well as the Maritime Silk Road – a network of ports and sea lanes. Newer initiatives include the Ice Silk road – a proposed northern Maritime route, and the super grip, which would include the development of six ultra high voltage electrical grids across various parts of Asia. Critics such as Deborah Brautigam of Johns Hopkins University, Lee Jones of the University of London and Shahar Hameiri of the University of Queensland argue that there is scant evidence to support concerns of debt-trap diplomacy. Wikipedia describes debt-trap diplomacy as a “situation where a powerful lending country or institution seeks to saddle a borrowing nation with debt to increase its leverage over it.” The term was initially promoted by Brahma Chellaney, an Indian academic, in 2017.

Question: What are China's strategic goals behind lending?
Answer:  -increase PRC military capability to strengthen deterrence against U.S. military intervention in the region;   BEIJING (Reuters) - Behind China’s trillion-dollar effort to build a modern Silk Road is a lending program of unprecedented breadth, one that will help build ports, roads and rail links, but could also leave some banks and many countries with quite a hangover. At the heart of that splurge are China’s two policy lenders, China Development Bank (CDB) and Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM), which have between them already provided $200 billion in loans throughout Asia, the Middle East and even Africa. "China's international lending boom is primarily a result of the country's rapid economic growth, but also due to the "going global" policy of the Chinese state," says Trebesch, who is head of the research area international finance and global governance at the Kiel Institute. China has been criticized for saddling many countries with debt through its Belt and Road Initiative — a mammoth global infrastructure investment plan to build rail, road, sea and other routes stretching from China to Central Asia, Africa and Europe. The documentation of China's lending has been at best "opaque," the report said, with such transactions "missed even by the most ambitious recent attempts to measure international capital flows."
------------------------------
Question: How much debt is owed to China from debt diplomacy?
Answer:  In many vulnerable countries, much of the burdensome debt is owed to a single source: China. According to a study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), from 2013 to 2016, China’s contribution to the public debt of heavily indebted poor countries nearly doubled from 6.2 percent to 11.6 percent. China’s lending is expanding even more through BRI. China focuses on financing impoverished, low-income, or economically troubled nations. As of 2020, it owed roughly USD 170 billion to low- and middle-income countries. This loan is heavily tied to the BRI and Infrastructural projects, including roadways, trains, ports and airports, mining and energy. According to AidData, over 40 economically fragile nations have “hidden debt” to Chinese lenders totalling over 10 per cent of their GDP.
------------------------------
Question: What are the benefits and risks of debt diplomacy projects?
Answer:  China’s Belt and Road Initiative has raised important questions about the risk of debt problems in less-developed countries. The risks are serious for the small and fragile economies of the Pacific. However, the analysis finds a different picture. The evidence to date suggests China has not been engaged in deliberate ‘debt trap’ diplomacy in the PICs. The Belt and Road projects have brought effective investment to the relevant countries rather than the so-called debt trap, boosted local economy and improved people’s livelihood. In such a scenario, the economic benefits of China’s debt-driven projects to recipient nations’ populations are an afterthought. And the lack of transparency in China’s lending obscures its risks to recipient countries, many of which are already vulnerable to or are suffering from financial or fiscal distress.
------------------------------
Question: What are the effects of Chinese loans to African economies?
Answer:  The implications for the Chinese investments and lending in Africa go beyond popular press headlines and political jabs to real and serious implications for development in Africa with concerns as to whether “China is making their [African countries] lunch or eating it”. In 2018, The Trump administration’s “A New Africa Strategy: Expanding Economic and Security Ties on the Basis of Mutual Respect,” mentions China 25 times yet fails to mention Nigeria or South Africa—the largest economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. This strategy was more for countering China than engaging with Africa. The magnitude of loans from China to African countries surpasses the amount of FDI investment by at least 3 to 4 times. Angola alone accounts for about a third of Chinese lending to Africa between 2000 and 2019; these loans are repaid with oil shipments.
------------------------------
Question: What is the financial and economic nature of relationships between China and African countries?
Answer:  Efforts renewed, the US building closer relationships with African countries can be a vital economic lifeline especially during times of financial instability and uncertainty; Covid-19 being the clearest example. On one spectrum, you have examples of Chinese predatory lending practices and in many cases Chinese aid has and continues to be inextricably linked with procurement to Chinese firms and State Owned Enterprises (SOE’s). The reciprocal nature of US firms implementing a Chinese aid project has been unheard of and or significantly less documented. China's flagship global development strategy, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), has led to $1 trillion spent in roughly 70 countries. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the true nature of Africa’s relationship with China? a relationship characterized by massive debt and economic dependence. Amid the pandemic, African countries faced both a health and economic crisis: they needed to protect their citizens’ health while minimizing economic shocks.
------------------------------
Question: What has the nature of China's investment activities been like over the last 20 years?
Answer:  The nature of the Bank’s activities in China has evolved over time as China’s needs and level of development have changed. More recently, this two-way relationship has evolved —the World Bank offers international expertise to help address China’s key development challenges and pilot reforms through projects and programs; and China’s development experiences enhance the Bank’s global knowledge and capacity to help other developing countries. Chinese investment has always been highly cyclical. Ever since the 1958 Great Leap Forward, growth in fixed capital formation has typically peaked about every five years. In China, the majority of investment is carried out by entities that are at least partially state-owned. Most of these are under the control of local governments.
------------------------------
Question: How does China's economy benefit or suffer from debt diplomacy strategies and investment?
Answer:  The debt trap is not new in the world and the third world countries are suffering from it (Dezner 2009). But the problem starts when China started to lend money which leads to acquire strategic assets from countries. In past some of the officials and researchers showed their concern over the Chinese money lending diplomacy. But after Chinese lease on Hambantota Port of Sri Lanka due to the inability of repaying the loans. Some countries that have taken loans from China are on the brink of bankruptcy as Sri Lanka. China might take advantages of that situation and take control of the sovereignty and strategic locations. As mentioned earlier, China is often accused of utilizing “debt diplomacy” to gain certain policy advantages in exchange for loans.

Question: Why do individuals tend to fail to save money for the future, behavioral economics?
Answer:  But the reward is delayed until the end of the month, decreasing the likelihood it will work. "If it's large and it's not immediate, it's less likely to work." Both Norton and John are experimenting with companies to design behavior change programs in a number of areas including health and financial savings. It's not always easy to implement behavioral economics techniques in a way that properly incentivizes people to change their behavior. When they are applied correctly, those changes are much more likely to stick. But the decline in savings is recent, and the human brain hasn’t evolved since the Ford administration. The bottom 90 percent of households saved 10 percent of their income in the first Reagan administration.

Question: Does the tax refund savings program work? behavioral economics
Answer:  Both Norton and John are experimenting with companies to design behavior change programs in a number of areas including health and financial savings. (Phys.org) —A new study of retirement plans in the US has demonstrated how adopting behavioral economics is encouraging people to increase their savings for retirement. Saving for retirement is a difficult cognitive and self-control problem and many low or middle-income earners have virtually no retirement savings because there is a stronger urge to spend now than to save for a period a long time in the future. Retirement savings are low in many countries, and in the US only about half have inadequate savings for retirment, but this is up from 31 percent only 30 years ago. At present only around 50 percent of American workers have access to retirement savings plans in their workplace. They suggested a simple way to lower the psychological barriers to joining a retirement plan is to use automatic enrollment, which makes opt-in the default . This works because less effort is then required to join the plan and forms need to be filled in to avoid joining. In the first company to adopt the SMarT plan employees who participated increased their savings from 3.5 percent to 13.6 percent over four years. This week, Benartzi and Thaler reported in the journal Science on their large-scale field study of the impacts of the suggested behavioral economics changes are having on retirement plans. They report that since 2005 companies providing an auto-enrollment retirement plan for their employees has risen from 19 to 56 percent. Over 50 percent of the retirement plans in the US now have automatic escalation, which is up from 9 percent, and this has resulted in an increase in annual retirement savings by $7.4 billion.

Question: How do you implement mental accounting?
Answer:  Mental accounting, a behavioral economics concept introduced in 1999 by Nobel Prize-winning economist Richard Thaler, refers to the different values people place on money, based on subjective criteria, that often has detrimental results.Mental accounting often leads people to make irrational investment decisions and behave in financially counterproductive or detrimental ways, such as funding a low-interest savings account while carrying large credit card balances.To avoid the mental accounting bias, individuals should treat money as perfectly fungible when they allocate among different accounts, be it a budget account (everyday living expenses), a discretionary spending account, or a wealth account (savings and investments). Richard Thaler, currently a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, introduced mental accounting in his 1999 paper "Mental Accounting Matters," which appeared in the Journal of Behavioral Decision Making. For example, we may earmark $50 a week for entertainment and $100 for food. Mental accounting suggests people do not treat money as fungible (the concept all money is interchangeable), but mentally link spending to particular budgets.

Question: what is the ellsberg paradox
Answer:  ^ T. Y. Chow, "The surprise examination or unexpected hanging paradox," The American Mathematical Monthly Jan 1998  ???? ?????? 07 ?????? 2015 ??? ???? ??? ??? ????. ^ R. A. Sorensen, Blindspots, Clarendon Press, Oxford (1988) ????? ????  The Ellsberg paradox is a paradox of choice in which people's decisions produce inconsistencies with subjective expected utility theory. The paradox was popularized by Daniel Ellsberg in his 1961 paper “Risk, Ambiguity, and the Savage Axioms”, although a version of it was noted considerably earlier by John Maynard Keynes. It is generally taken to be evidence for ambiguity aversion, in which a person tends to prefer choices with quantifiable risks over those with unknown, incalculable risks.
------------------------------
Question: what is the allais paradox
Answer:  The Allais paradox is a choice problem designed by Maurice Allais (1953) to show an inconsistency of actual observed choices with the predictions of expected utility theory. The payoffs for each gamble in each experiment are as follows:  The Allais Paradox refers to a classic hypothetical choice problem in behavioral economics that exposes human irrationality. Daniel Kahneman offered a simplified version of the puzzle in his seminal book, Thinking, Fast and Slow1:
------------------------------
Question: Do most people rely on heuristics when making decisions under time pressure?
Answer:  When making decisions under risk and uncertainty, people often rely on heuristics. A heuristic is a simple decision rule that allows one to make judgments without integrating all the information available. But in many other instances, heuristics support effective decision making in complex situations and lead to sufficient outcomes, which is the focus of the fast and frugal heuristics approach. RQ2: Do decision makers who score high on the rational dimension apply the take-the-best heuristic rather than other heuristics when they are under time pressure? As take-the-best may be considered the easiest way to reach a decision that is at least partly rational, we expect rational decision makers to switch from a thorough analysis of the problem to a take-the-best heuristic under time pressure. Recognition based decision rules can be considered a comparatively easy way to reach a decision, and do not require acquisition of further information on product attributes.
------------------------------
Question: The satisficing procedure is unlikely to perform well in an environment where the decision maker is learning about the options as she samples them.
Answer:  Results show that the satisficing choice model of this paper is of a certain theoretical guiding significance to a kind of emergency decisions made by decision-makers under the circumstance of time pressure and limited information. It can also be the theoretical foundation for the study on the boundedly rational decision-making. Simon  presented further the principle of satisficing heuristic, that is, individuals discover and analyze alternatives sequentially and stop searching as soon as they identify the first alternative that they judge to be satisfactory. Aguiar et al.  developed necessary and sufficient conditions for stochastic choice data to be consistent with satisficing, assuming that preferences are fixed, but search order may change randomly. Brady and Rehbeck  examined the role of stochastic feasibility in consumer choice using a random conditional choice set rule and characterized the model from conditions on stochastic choice data. Caplin et al.  and Stüttgen et al. ’s experimental results showed that individual behavior is consistent with the satisficing heuristic. A series of nested sets are used to describe the consideration set in the abovementioned literatures. This means that the number of alternatives in the DM’s consideration set will increase with the extension of the search time. In order to improve the efficiency of decision-making, a series of incompatible sets are used to describe the consideration set in this paper. This implies that it is not necessary to compare the newly added alternatives with all the original alternatives. Therefore, the DM can obtain a satisfactory alternative with a high probability in a short time. Under the circumstance of time constraint and limited information, the DM often want to quickly obtain a satisfactory alternative and cannot compare all alternatives. This means that the DM’s preferences may not be complete.

Question: 5.	What are some main differences between System 1 and System 2 thinking?
Answer: System 1 governs automatic and unconscious thinking processes, while system two governs conscious deliberation. The concept of system 1 and system 2 thinking was first introduced by psychologist and behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman. The unconscious realm of System 1 is far more important than we tend to recognize since it is the source of all our sensory perceptions, automatic motor and cognitive processes, and snap judgments. System 1 was crucial for human evolution. Early human hunter-gatherers who reacted instinctively to the snap of a twig were far more likely to survive than those who took the time to consciously decide whether the sound most likely came from a predator. In a nutshell: System 1’s type of thinking is automatic, associative and intuitive; it tends to respond quickly, but consequently it is at higher risk of jumping to wrong conclusions. It is the ‘default’ type of thinking that guides human judgement, decisions and behaviour much of the time.
------------------------------
Question: (d)	Which one is greater - expected value or expected utility? Is this consistent with the utility function being concave?
Answer:  $\begingroup$ Also, as @Giskard mentioned, utility representation of a vNM-consistent preference does not have to take the expected utility form. May 16, 2019 at 16:02 While it is true that a function has the expected utility form if and only if it is linear (in probabilities), it is not the case that any linear function can represent a preference that satisfies the vNM axioms. May 16, 2019 at 19:30 It would suffice to show that $U$ is linear.
------------------------------
Question: What is loss aversion
Answer: Loss aversion in behavioral economics refers to a phenomenon where a real or potential loss is perceived by individuals as psychologically or emotionally more severe than an equivalent gain. When it comes to decision making, s/he takes the gain associated with the investment into high consideration rather than the loss with a prime motto to avoid the risk linked to the loss. The research that falls under the domain of loss aversion suggests, losses are twice as powerful as gains implying the pain of losing in the financial market is twice as powerful as the joy of gaining. For instance, when you compare the satisfaction, a person gains from winning $100 in the market with the loss of satisfaction from losing $100, it is the fact that the second scenario outweighs the first one, as per the theory of Loss Aversion. It is because s/he will lose more satisfaction during the losses if compared to the gain of satisfaction when gaining the same amount of capital s/he had lost previously. For instance, the pain of losing $100 is often far greater than the joy gained in finding the same amount.
------------------------------
Question: What is a reference point in behavioral economics
Answer:  The concept of the reference point is a key aspect of prospect theory. This theory, which serves as a behavioral model for decision-making under uncertainty, was first introduced by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their paper, “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk”, published in Econometrica in 1979.7 They continued to develop the theory over the next thirty years. In 1992, the famous duo published a paper entitled “Advances in Prospect Theory: Cumulative Representation of Uncertainty.” In this paper, the researchers expanded upon the existing version of prospect theory, developing what they called “cumulative prospect theory.”8 This updated version of the theory was developed to account for some issues with the mathematical models of prospect theory. Since its conception, prospect theory has been applied in many different areas, from economics to political science, in order to predict outcomes and understand the decision-making processes of different parties. Behavioral economics uses an understanding of human psychology to account for why people deviate from rational action when they’re making decisions. In the model of rational action assumed by traditional economics, a person is expected to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of an action and then choose the option in their own self-interest. Behavioral economic theories are used to explain most everyday decisions, such as what people buy, how they manage their finances, and whether or not they make healthy lifestyle choices.
------------------------------
Question: concavity of utility functions behavioral economics
Answer:  A utility function in general has only ordinal meaning, any monotone transformation preserves the order isomorphism of the underlying preference ordering. However, there are several econometrics papers, that estimate demand with concavity shape restrictions on the utility. But "standard" ordinal utility is not compatible with Econometrics, because Econometrics deal inherently with situations where there exists uncertainty, and in a framework with uncertainty we move from "fully ordinal utility" to Expected Utility theory, where properties like concavity have economically meaningful content -they express attitude towards risk (as well as "preference intensity", as this laborious post shows). The concavity assumption/restriction is made because there is universal consensus that the vast majority of people exhibit risk aversion in their economic behavior.

Question: Similarities and fundamental differences of informal social networks in China (guanxi) and Korea (yongo)
Answer:  Within an analytical framework derived from social capital and institutional theory, the structural forms and characteristics of both network forms are compared. Although we observe some similarities, surprisingly, the two networks show several fundamental differences. Both are large, society spanning constructs, developed and maintained by reciprocal action that creates trust and trustworthiness and serves as a major factor of network cohesion. Both networks are relatively closed or inaccessible to outsiders, with insiders able to connect other insiders to each other (i.e., internal bridging of structural holes). However, guanxi can be characterized as being utilitarian (purpose-based), whereas yongo in principle describes cause-based ties. The results add knowledge to social network theory in general and in particular on informal social networks in East Asia. However, in comparison, Guanxi networks are in principle accessible to outsiders and draw on a diverse base of ties; Yongo networks are predefined, partly by birth, and are hence homogeneous and highly exclusive.
------------------------------
Question: what is guanxi
Answer:  The Chinese call this guanxi (??). The key is to remain diligent and be aware that the reciprocal nature of guanxi also dictates an informal obligation to 'return the favour'. Guanxi (pronounced gwan' CH?) is a Chinese term meaning relationships; in business, it commonly refers to the networks or connections used to open doors for new business and facilitate deals. The term refers not just to the existence of relationships but to their nature: to having personal trust and a strong relationship. It can also create moral obligations and require the exchanging of favors. Guanxi implies an obligation that one has to another. In China, the belief is that the wheels of business are lubricated with guanxi.

Question: lung involvement in sarcoidosis
Answer:  Localization to the lungs is by far the most common manifestation of sarcoidosis. At least 90% of those affected experience lung involvement. In acute and subacute cases,  physical examination usually reveals dry crackles. At least 5% of cases include pulmonary arterial hypertension. The upper respiratory tract (including the larynx, pharynx, and sinuses) may be affected, which occurs in between 5 and 10% of cases. The four stages of pulmonary involvement are based on radiological stage of the disease, which is helpful in prognosis:  The lungs are the most commonly affected organ in sarcoidosis. Ninety percent or more of people with sarcoidosis have lung involvement, whether they have symptoms or not.

Question: How do humans/societies respond to radical new ideas?
Answer:  Because human enhancement is still largely an issue for the future, it has not yet attracted a lot of attention in American religious communities. There is, for instance, no official teaching or statement on human enhancement or transhumanism that has come directly from any of the major churches or religious groups in the United States. However, some theologians, religious ethicists and religious leaders have started to think about the implications of human enhancement in light of their traditions’ teachings, offering a sense of how their churches or religions might respond to radical human enhancement if it became possible. All of the Abrahamic faiths – Judaism, Christianity and Islam – share the belief that men and women have been created, to some extent, in God’s image. According to many theologians, the idea that human beings in certain ways mirror God make some, but not all, religious denominations within this broad set of connected traditions wary of using new technologies to enhance or change people, rather than heal or restore them.

Question: What are some benefits of dual-language immersion?
Answer:  The integrated nature of dual language programs brings further benefits to ELLs in US classrooms. In contrast to English-only classes, these students are able to continue to use their native language in dual language immersion classrooms and also maintain their sense of identity and heritage. This can be a boost to student self-esteem and confidence. In turn, this confidence helps to improve students’ communication skills, both in their new language and their native one. Through re-learning how to express themselves, they improve their ability to communicate clearly. A number of these programs are already reporting academic and social gains from participating students, findings that build on a growing body of research that shows dual immersion offers academic and social benefits for English learners and fluent English speakers. A study of Portland’s program, for example, found that students enrolled in dual-language immersion programs had much better English reading scores than peers in English-only programs. And at Bethesda, the school’s academic growth is higher than 91 percent of schools in Georgia, and the percentages of students scoring proficient or better on standardized math, science, and social studies tests are above state averages.

Question: How do 50/50 and 90/10 differ?
Answer:  The .50-90 Sharps rifle cartridge is a black-powder cartridge that was introduced by Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company in 1872 as a buffalo (American bison) hunting round. The standard factory loads, produced and sold by the Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company and the Sharps Rifle Company were .50/100/425 (.50 caliber/100 grains black powder/425 grain grease grooved bullet) and .50/100/473 with a paper patched bullet. Winchester offered the cartridge loaded .50/90/473 with paper patched bullets which may be how the cartridge came to be commonly known as the .50-90. The .50-90 Sharps is similar to the .50-100 Sharps and .50-110 Sharps cartridges. All rifles made for the .50-90 Sharps should be able to use the .50-110 and .50-100 cartridges due to the case dimensions being nearly identical. Of course, the “90/10” rule is merely a suggested benchmark, which may be easily modified to reflect a given investor’s tolerance to investment risk. For instance, an investor who sits at the lower end of the risk spectrum may adopt a 40/60 or even 30/70 split model.

Question: What demographic, social, and or economic factors led to the arab spring uprising in syria
Answer:  The Arab Spring (Arabic: ?????? ??????) was a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions that spread across much of the Arab world in the early 2010s. It began in response to corruption and economic stagnation and was first started in Tunisia. In the news, social media has been heralded as the driving force behind the swift spread of revolution throughout the world, as new protests appear in response to success stories shared from those taking place in other countries. The wave of initial revolutions and protests faded by mid-2012, as many Arab Spring demonstrations were met with violent responses from authorities, as well as from pro-government militias, counter-demonstrators, and militaries. The largest change from the pre-revolution to the post-revolution was in the attempt to break up political elites and reshape the geopolitical structure of the middle east. It is speculated that many of the changes brought on by the Arab Spring will lead to a shifting of regional power in the Middle East and a quickly changing structure of power. The support, even if tacit, of national military forces during protests has also been correlated to the success of the Arab Spring movement in different countries. In Saudi Arabia and Syria, where the ruling elite was closely linked with ethnic or religious subdivisions of society, the military sided with the existing regime and took on the ostensible role of protector to minority populations. The presence of a strong, educated middle class has been noted as a correlate to the success of the Arab Spring in different countries. Countries with strong welfare programs and a weak middle class, such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan, as well as countries with great economic disparity and an impoverished working class—including Yemen, Libya, and Morocco—did not experience successful revolutions.

Answer:  At its most basic, a cryptocurrency is a digital asset that utilizes computer code and blockchain technology to operate somewhat on its own, without the need for a central party — be that a person, company, central bank or government — to manage the system. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.

Question: What are the key principles of constructivism in the study of international relations
Answer:  Constructivism theories in international affairs are based on the assumption that nations, like humans, exist in a world of our making in which certain concepts, such as social facts, gender roles are created by human activity, as opposed to brute facts, which are developed independently (Onuf, 1989). Its arguments are based on concepts such as discourses, conventions, identities, and social interaction, which are widely used in contemporary conversations about a variety of international matters such as globalization, international human rights, defence policy, and others. Constructivism believes that the structure of the international system cannot be uniformly applied to all state relations as it mainly bases the relations and interactions between countries and their shared understandings as the sources of conflicts or cooperation. In international relations, constructivism is a social theory that asserts that significant aspects of international relations are shaped by ideational factors (which are historically and socially constructed), not simply material factors. The most important ideational factors are those that are collectively held; these collectively held beliefs construct the interests and identities of actors. Similarly to rational choice, constructivism does not make broad and specific predictions about international relations; it is an approach to studying international politics, not a substantive theory of international politics.

Question: How to get into college
Answer:  Students who get accepted to their first choice college also have another thing in common: They spend a good portion of their high school career preparing for the college admissions process. Some colleges have a range of grade point averages (GPA) that they prefer. For example, you may need at least a 2.5 GPA to apply. Getting into college isn't as difficult as most people think it is. There are colleges out there who will take anyone who has the tuition money. According to UCLA's annual CIRP Freshman Survey, more than half of students get accepted to their first choice college. This is no accident; many of these students apply to a school that is a good fit for their academic ability, personality, and career goals.

Question: explain the Ukrain conflict from A Realist perspective
Answer:  The main idea is that whether or not the interventions of Russia in the post-Soviet countries can be perceived legitimized form realist perspective or not When the demise of the Soviet Union was near, western states asked Mikhail Gorbachev for the reunion of West and East Germany. The reunification went ahead peacefully and the European leaders promised Gorbachev that from that time on, even one inch of the Communist orbit will not be incorporated in the West orbit. Western Leaders did not keep their words and year by year they grabbed the former states of the Warsaw pact into the NATO. This trend continued and this time was the turn for the farmer Soviet Unions states to be gulped down by the incorporated into NATO. Countries of East Baltic Sea including Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania were warmly accepted as the new members of NATO. But this time Russia`s reaction became totally different, First Moscow warned seriously to the European states about the acceptance of Baltic sea countries in the NATO and while realized that these peaceful and nonviolent requests will never change the insatiable greed of eastward NATO desires, resorted to military measures and sent troops to convert the the war’s scene, but this time in Georgia toward the pro-Russian groups. Now Ukraine is the latest battlefield of confrontation among Russia and NATO (on the behalf of the United Stated and its European states). Experts explain the current Russia-Ukraine conflict from various perspectives. Although liberalism can explain the war to some extent, realism is able to explain the entire situation better. However, it should be noted that classical realism, which is based solely on power and blames mankind’s egoism, may not be able to explain every aspect of the ongoing war.

Question: explain the controversy over a non-recursive languages
Answer:  In the 1970s, Everett lived for an extended time among the Pirahã, who reside along the Maici River, which branches off the Amazon. He published a doctoral dissertation on them in the 1980s, but the controversy over the Pirahã language did not explode until 2005, when Everett published a scholarly article making the case for the language’s unique properties, including its apparent lack of recursion. Those stories were transcribed by Everett and Steve Sheldon, a missionary who lived among the Pirahã people in the 1970s. Using the 1,100 sentences in the corpus, the researchers analyzed each one to see if they could find examples of several types of “recursive embedding.” For instance, they looked for examples of “center embedding,” in which a clause is inserted into the middle of a sentence. No examples of it were present in the Pirahã dataset. If a Language is undecidable(non-recursive), there must be some strings make the TM fail to halt.SO IT MUST HAVE INFINITE OF THEM WHICH MAKE THE TM FAILS TO HALT.

Question: trends inoffice interior design
Answer:  Flexible workspaces that are dynamic is the new normal. The workers want flexible workspace and pod-style design because employees are seeking private corners for safe working, to attend meetings, to make calls, for any research purpose, etc. If  We have no options for that we can use natural light effects for that appearance. The majority of the office interior select the green option now. This green option influences the employee’s mind, through this green option we can bring the outside greenery to inside this will help to decrease the stress level, bring a homely feel to the employees and moreover that there are some health benefits also. Another most essential and latest trend that is seen in office interiors is mixing the old and new design. Companies are becoming increasingly complex in their functions and technology. Therefore, the importance of interior work in the office also increases. So all the companies are opting for the latest trends in office interior design and mainly focusing on safety at the whole level, comfort, employees relaxation, color textures, etc.

Question: what is logistic regression
Answer:  Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method to predict a binary outcome, such as yes or no, based on prior observations of a data set. A logistic regression model predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables. For example, a logistic regression could be used to predict whether a political candidate will win or lose an election or whether a high school student will be admitted or not to a particular college. These binary outcomes allow straightforward decisions between two alternatives. Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm widely used for classification.

Question: what is zero shot learning?
Answer:  Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a problem setup in machine learning, where at test time, a learner observes samples from classes, which were not observed during training, and needs to predict the class that they belong to. Zero-shot methods generally work by associating observed and non-observed classes through some form of auxiliary information, which encodes observable distinguishing properties of objects. For example, given a set of images of animals to be classified, along with auxiliary textual descriptions of what animals look like, an artificial intelligence model which has been trained to recognize horses, but has never been given a zebra, can still recognize a zebra when it also knows that zebras look like striped horses. This problem is widely studied in computer vision, natural language processing, and machine perception. Xian, Yongqin, Christoph H. Lampert, Bernt Schiele, and Zeynep Akata.

Question: what is vechain
Answer: VeChain accomplishes this by providing cutting-edge solutions for enterprises in the form of an internet of things (IoT) devices that track goods and services from origin to destination. Its goal is to streamline these processes and information flow for complex supply chains through the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT). VeChain makes use of two tokens: VeChain token (VET) as a value layer and VeChain Thor Energy (VTHO) as a smart contract layer. There are two main layers to the VeChain blockchain, an IoT-based token layer that uses a blockchain to capture and record activity from IoT devices, and a smart contract layer that companies can leverage to track ownership of their goods and services as well as build their own decentralized applications (dApps).

Question: what is neural style transfer
Answer:  Neural style transfer (NST) refers to a class of software algorithms that manipulate digital images, or videos, in order to adopt the appearance or visual style of another image. NST algorithms are characterized by their use of deep neural networks for the sake of image transformation. Common uses for NST are the creation of artificial artwork from photographs, for example by transferring the appearance of famous paintings to user-supplied photographs. Several notable mobile apps use NST techniques for this purpose, including DeepArt and Prisma. This method has been used by artists and designers around the globe to develop new artwork based on existent style(s). Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image. This is implemented by optimizing the output image to match the content statistics of the content image and the style statistics of the style reference image.

Question: What is asynchronous online learning
Answer:  Asynchronous learning is a general term used to describe forms of education, instruction, and learning that do not occur in the same place or at the same time. Digital and online learning experiences can also be synchronous. For example, educational video conferences, interactive webinars, chat-based online discussions, and lectures that are broadcast at the same time they given would all be considered forms of synchronous learning. In the world of online learning, this allows you to learn at your own pace regardless of timezone, location, or schedule. It means that the teacher and student are likely on different schedules and not communicating live.

Question: what is asynchronous online education
Answer:  Asynchronous learning is a general term used to describe forms of education, instruction, and learning that do not occur in the same place or at the same time. For example, educational video conferences, interactive webinars, chat-based online discussions, and lectures that are broadcast at the same time they given would all be considered forms of synchronous learning. Asynchronous online learning is a good option for those who can stick to deadlines and complete work without a teacher standing over their shoulders. An asynchronous online degree lets you earn a college degree while working from home and logging into the dedicated system to complete work and interact with others a few times a week. It’s also a chance for working professionals, long-distance learners and other non-traditional students to fit a college education into their lives despite busy schedules or remote locations.

Question: ablation in machine learning
Answer:  In artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML), ablation is the removal of a component of an AI system. An ablation study investigates the performance of an AI system by removing certain components to understand the contribution of the component to the overall system. Other analogies include other neuroscience biological systems such as Drosophilla central nervous system and the vertebrate brain. Ablation studies require that a system exhibit graceful degradation: the system must continue to function even when certain components are missing or degraded. The ablation process can be used to test systems that perform tasks such as speech recognition, visual object recognition, and robot control. In general, an ablation study is a set of experiments in which components of a machine learning system are removed/replaced in order to measure the impact of these components on the performance of the system.

Question: difference between data wrangling and data cleaning
Answer:  Data wrangling is the process of transforming and mapping data from one raw data form into another form with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for various tasks. In contrast, data cleaning is the process of detecting and removing corrupted or inaccurate records from a record set, table or database. Data wrangling and data cleaning are two processes that we can perform on data to obtain meaningful data. It’s also because they share some common attributes. However, the main difference between data wrangling and data cleaning is that data wrangling is the process of converting and mapping data from one format to another format to use that data to perform analyzing while data cleaning is the process of eliminating the incorrect data or to modify them. To confuse matters (and because data wrangling is not always well understood) the term is often used to describe each of these steps individually, as well as in combination. Data cleaning, meanwhile, is a single aspect of the data wrangling process. Data cleaning falls under this umbrella, alongside a range of other activities.
------------------------------
Question: example of data wrangling
Answer: Other commonly used examples of data wrangling include: Merging multiple data sources into a single data setIdentifying extreme outliers in data and removing them to allow for proper analysisIdentifying gaps in data, such as empty spreadsheet cells, and removing or filling themCleaning up inconsistent values and tags Data wrangling is the act of extracting data and converting it to a workable format, while ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a process for data integration. Data wrangling uses a variety of processes to transform raw data into easily understandable and ready-to-use formats, with methods varying from project to project based on the goal. This allows an organization to maintain a backlog of accessible data so insights can be more easily unearthed from within a dataset Data wrangling is also known as data cleansing, data remediation and data munging. If a company wants to standardize dates within a data set where entries varied in formatting, data wrangling tools make that possible at scale. Python is a popular example of a scripting language that is used for data wrangling, and writing data structures and algorithms. It focuses on readability and has a large community that has created thousands of libraries (or “packages”) for data wrangling purposes. Packages are collections of pre-written modules that can automate processes a data analyst would otherwise have to complete manually. For example, when standardizing the country name format for a set of data, a data analyst would have to manually sift through the data to categorize it correctly. One example of this would be to create an algorithm that would transform the word “Germany” in every language into the text string “Germany.”

Question: Examples of misinformation in fitness supplements
Answer:  Rachel Scheer is a Certified Nutritionist who received her degree from Baylor University in Nutrition Science and Dietetics. Proof has been offered that misinformation that is only slightly misleading has about a 50:50 chance of raising the recipient's fitness; hence, to be effective a lie must be grossly misinformative. The existence of certain meaningless rituals that might be thought of as misinformative can be explained by kin or group selection. During the initial stages of selection, according to the model presented here, the gene in question is favored because relatives are not misled as are other members of the population (fig. Thus, although certain rituals may indeed start their existence as examples of willfully transmitted misinformation, their incorporation into the overall species behavior makes this description superfluous. Because the fitness industry is a very-high revenue industry, people market anything to make money. This misinformation spreads through products, celebrities, and influencers.

Question: misinformation in fitness supplements
Answer:  Misinformation Dr Mary Flynn, chief specialist in public health nutrition with the FSAI, said young people were exposed to a "significant amount of misinformation on sports nutrition, which has potential negative implications for their health now and in the future". Because the fitness industry is a very-high revenue industry, people market anything to make money. This misinformation spreads through products, celebrities, and influencers. With people claiming different methods for weight loss or weight gain with little to no scientific backing. In simpler words, misinformation in the fitness industry is rampant. Products like body wraps, slimming shoes, creams, fat-burning pills, starch blockers, apple- cider vinegar have been heavily marketed. With companies claiming quick fat loss with little to no work. And even though there have been numerous scientific studies that disprove this, these products still sell. It is due to a lack of awareness among consumers.

Question: Hydroflask
Answer:  Hydro Flask is a water bottle brand owned by Helen of Troy Limited. The brand became very popular during mid-late 2019 and early 2020, particularly among millennials, members of Generation Z, college students, and members of the "VSCO girl" subculture. The popularity is credited to many social stars, especially on platforms such as TikTok. Its trendiness has been credited to rising environmental and health consciousness as well as the quality and appearance of the water bottle. Hydro Flask was founded in 2009 by Travis Rosbach and his then-girlfriend, Cindy Weber, due to his dissatisfaction with commercial water bottles. It was formally known as Steel Technologies LLC. The couple moved to Bend, Oregon to market their product and it enjoyed early success at local farmers markets, especially among the outdoor recreation community there. Hydro Flask water bottles are designed with double-wall vacuum insulation, which keeps liquids hot for up to 12 hours or cold for up to 24 hours. The anti-condensation technology in every Hydro Flask bottle helps keep your hands or backpack dry.
