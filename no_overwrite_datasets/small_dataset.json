Evidence suggests that steeply dipping sheets at the margins of some plutons were emplaced sub horizontally and then tilted at the margin of a sagging floor. It is thought that plutons are fed by dikes and have grown by this process. This is evident in McDoogle pluton in the Sierra Nevada; this pluton is compositionally layered parallel to its contacts and contains numerous thin concordant panels of wall rock.[4] Ascent by stoping is less feasible with incremental emplacement because if the active magma body is below the top of a pluton, stoping rearranges material within the pluton and produces no overall ascent. To reach a position at the top of the older increments, an increment would have to stop its way upward through all previous increments.[2] The rheology of host rock plays a key role: hard rock will be able to stop magma ascent [5][6] Magma emplacement occurs as pulses, with repose time.

As there exist a number of techniques used for such purposes, they can be split into one of two classifications; first generation techniques and second generation techniques. First generation techniques work on the basis of the simple dichotomy of 'fits\/doesn't fit' in the matching of the error situation in context with related error identification and quantification and second generation techniques are more theory based in their assessment and quantification of errors.

For matter\/anti-matter touching does that. Instant energy.

But that's another discussion.)\n\nAnyway, that caused ripples and disparate distribution in the smoothness of the matter, and because matter has gravity and also an electromagnetic charge to it, this 'clumpiness' caused denser places than others.  \n\nThese denser clumps of what later condensated into Hydrogen (H) became big enough to let there be light, as many large and in charge stars came to be born.  These stars were also in bigger clumps, and so they became galaxies.  Probably, possibly, just irregular globular cluster types rather than any spiral or such, at first.\n\nThen the stars, so heavy, so fast burning and blue, blew the hell up and spewed enriched guts (one of my favorite DeGrasse Tysonisims) and energy shockwaves all over the place, causing further disturbances in the smoothness of the universe.  \n\nThese then shoved other clouds of matter, hydrogen laden, to be disturbed, form more stars, repeating the process.  Eventually, these clouds of matter also came to have the other elements like silicon, gold, etc, that would allow rocky planets to form about these stars, all due to the over and over cycle of stars blowing up and making more of the heavier elements past Iron (Fe).\n\nAnd further, it caused more clumping of matter, and that into stars, but those stars were already centered around themselves and their clouds, so galaxies.

If you carefully remove your hand the sand stays and makes a tunnel\/bridge.

But , sometimes those pockets of water can be drained out over long periods of time or from movements in the earth leaving big bubbles of air.

{"text":"Geologist here. Sinkholes are a byproduct of a geologic term known as karsting. \n\nThe process of karsting starts with a lithology (rock type) that allows for the water table (aquifer) to move through it with ease. This means that the rock (in the case of a skin hole: limestone) must have both porosity and permeability. Porosity of a rock are the tiny empty void spaces between the individual grains or crystals, while the permeability of the rock is the ability for the fluids (in this case water) to flow between the porosity void spaces. Both porosity and permeability are an absolute necessity for an aquifer to exist. Most folks tend to think of aquifers as underground rivers and lakes, but the vast majority of aquifers are nothing more than a giant \"sponge\" that holds the fluids under the lithostatic pressures of the overlying rocks. \n\nHowever, in the case of sinkholes or karst topography, the aquifers are in fact underground river systems! (Formed by the following process)\n\nThe process of sinkhole formation begins with a rainstorm which is absorbed into the ground through an aquifer recharge zone. Because the pH of rainwater can vary from 7.0 to 5.6, the water is in fact an acid which can be corrosive to aquifers. As the rain water enters the recharge zone and enters the water table, it begins to interact with carbonate rocks such as limestone (CaCO3) or dolomite (MgCa(CO3)2). Both of these rock type react violently with acids, something that you can directly test by pouring a small amount of acid on an outcrop.\n\n Anyways.. back to the sinkholes. In the distant past, the acidic rainwater moves through the highly permeable limestones and dolomites and begins to actively dissolve them. This is the first stage of a cave system and the formation of an \"underground river\" cave system. Now mind you.. it isn't actually a river, but more of an labyrinth of endless dark underwater pathways. As geologic time passes, the aquifer and water table will inevitability begin to drop. As this happens, the waterlogged caverns begin to drain, leaving vast pockets under the ground. \n\n(This is where the sinkholes come in). Since water is not compressible, the aquifer was essentially holding up the overburden of the overlying rocks. With the water gone, gravity begins to do its nasty work. Over time, water from more rainwater will begin to percolate through the rocks dissolving and precipitating (Think stalagmites and stalactites in a cave system). The water is once again actively eating away at the rock, making the overlying rock weaker and more prone to cave in. This continues until one day gravities pull is too strong, causing the overlying buildings, roads, sediments, etc to be consumed, effectively falling down into the base of the cave system that started forming a long long time ago. \n\nHope this helps! \u270c\u26cf","label":"the process of how sinkholes occur","__index_level_0__":85}

{"text":"Fascism is an ideology that has three fundamental tenets: Paternalism, Corporatism, and Nationalism. Each fascist movement was unique, but these three basic attributes are shared. One could also add anti-Marxism to it. \n\nPaternalism refers to the hierarchical system of fascist politics. The state is the supreme authority, and this is in the people's interests. Liberty is a secondary concern. An apt analogy is the family: in fascism, the state plays the role of a father figure. Again, liberty is unimportant - much as the liberty of a child who wants to not eat his vegetables or do his homework is unimportant. \n\nCorporatism is more complicated. It has nothing to do with corporations, as known in our society - the word comes from the Latin 'corpus'.  It is the view that society can be divided into concrete groups, known as corporations. Another way to view them is as special interest groups. In a fascist society, people would be represented by these corporations. For example, in government, instead of a Congressman from Michigan, there might be a Congressman for Auto Workers. All Auto Workers would belong to a single union, and elect a representative (or have one appointed). In addition, fascism preaches tripartism. In it, society is divided into two sectors - labor and management - with a third sector, the state, reigning supreme, and being responsible for ensuring neither hurts the interests of the state. This is the most complicated aspect of fascism, and I have not come close to covering it here. If you want more detail, I'd be happy to provide it. \n\nThe final component is nationalism - the idea that a person's national identity is the most important aspect of their personal identity. The nation is supreme, and again, the individual is relatively unimportant. An analogy might be the human body. A kidney, or individual, by itself is meaningless - it is only when it exists in conjunction with the other organs that it becomes a body, or nation. \n\nFascism is neither good nor bad, like communism. Some leaders are not seen as positive - Hitler, or Mussolini. Others, more neutrally - Franco. Others still are still regarded positively today by their nations - Peron, or Vargas.","label":"defintiion of fascism and its drawbacks","__index_level_0__":89}

{"text":"The reason behind Shakespeare being in the Curriculum is one that is quite anti-climactic. The reason we study Shakespeare is because he was not only a great Playwright, but a wordsmith and a lyrical genius. [He invented over 1700 words](_URL_0_).\n\nNot only that but the way he wrote was genius, because theatre in the 17th Century was very different, They had no use of lights, sound effects, props, backdrops. The reason Shakespeare work is so Long is because most of it is descriptive.  Instead of seeing a scene that has trees for a backdrop, and Leafy Gobos while being lit in a green tint, he had to describe the surroundings, and he had to make that as captivating as possible, he couldn't just blankly state \"She was beautiful\" The scope of that is so broad, as opposed to saying \"She is more bright than fire, more beautiful than a jewel, the world does not deserve this woman, she is making me question whether I had actually fallen in love before now\". Even his original actors would find surprises in the text due to them not knowing the whole script, but this is due to the fact that they had no way of mass printing and it would have taken one man ages to hand write multiple copies of the scripts.\n\nAs well as this, his structure is phenomenal, the way his stories unfold are brilliant in the way that it's unlikely enough to be entertainment, but plausible enough to be relatable. Take for example Macbeth: His paranoia and hunger for power increases and an alarming rate and most of the characters give the lead couple the benefit of the doubt extremely generously, but where it all comes from is completely understandable, think about all great men with a great woman behind them. On top of this, its the way he wrote lines, and dialogue, Things like Iambic pentameter (Having 10 syllables per line, and stressing all the even numbered ones. During a Iambic Pentameter speech, if one line has less than 10 Syllables, there should be a dramatic break.) and the way that some characters, couples mostly, conjoin their lines to make 10 syllables.\n\nWhich meads me onto \"But you can just get this from watching the play, right? If the actors are good\" But when:-\n\nProducers choose to do a modern translation or reduced text production\n\nDirectors have different intent, adaptions or dramatic choices\n\nActors have varied understandings or implications on lines\n\ncan result in a loss in translation. This is a very common thing to happen because Shakespeare's work is so adaptable to modern times and relevant Social\/Political\/Economical issues. It's well worth trying to see adaptions, which should be easy, Shakespeare's work is the most performed in the world. (In fact it is generally believed that his work is being performed every day somewhere in the world, most likely in more than one place) But the best option to be able to fully appreciate everything he did in writing, you have to read he work, to fully be able to analyse it. Of course, your analysis may be completely different to someone else's, which then will spark a debate and get people talking, which may make you want to go back to the text and read it again to find new things, and so on and so forth. \n\n**TL:DR:** The man's writing is so complex and layered, as well as the factor that modern performances have the license to change and adapt his work so much, that a lot of beautiful, lyrical and poetic writing gets lost.\n\n*Studied Theatre for 7 years.

If we detect some combinations of those, we typically perceive that as an \"in-between\" color.  For example, orange light stimulates both the red and green sensing cells in our eyes.  So stimulating the red and green cells is what we perceive as \"orange\".  And, interestingly, if we just use red and green light (no orange light), we can stimulate those cells exactly the same as orange light, and so we still see orange.  In fact, that's the basis for how computer and phone displays work:  They only emit red, green, and blue light, and our brains perceive combinations of those as other colors.\n\nBut here comes the strangeness!

Well, your first guess is that we should perceive the color that is \"in between\" red and blue on the spectrum.

{"text":"When you write software you use abstract terms.  For a simplified example, you might say something like \"Show this model on the screen\".  You do this through a graphics library like DirectX or OpenGL, or through some engine that converts it into a language like that.\n\nIn the long past, there was no graphics libraries, and there were no drivers from the manufacturers.  The programmers would have to know exactly what commands to send to every card.  Back then there were only a few models of popular video cards so this was something that could be done.  But as there started to be more models of video cards it started to be too hard to do well.  So maybe you need to load the shape of the model into the card in a very different way for one card than another.\n\nOut of this, OpenGL and eventually Direct3d became a thing.  The cards were designed to accept more general terms like \"load this model\".  The thing is the cards had to have some way of accepting these commands, and sometimes new cards with new features would come out and need to accept new features.  You couldn't rewrite DirectX or OpenGL every time you wanted to use one of these features, and you don't know on the card immediately what's the best way to do something. \n\nSo a driver is another translation layer.  The graphics library sends an instruction to the driver.  The driver decides what the best way to convert that instruction into commands to send to the card is.  When you get an updated driver it means that they've either fixed a problem in translation, or made an optimization that translates that better to the card that you have.   When new games come out, sometimes the game uses features in a graphics library in ways that are unexpected and can be optimized by changing how they are translated and given to the card, it's in the card manufacturer's best interest to make sure their cards perform well so they often work with developers to make sure they can get the best performance, sometimes necessitating a new driver version.","label":"justification for driver updates for GPUS","__index_level_0__":164}

These two weapons were very strong and efficient at countering basic medieval infantry, but vulnerable to attack. This led to the popularization of pike and halberd infantry defending arquebus or musket infantry formations with cavalry support, and a general disappearance of man-to-man combat that dominated medieval warfare. \n\nThe rapier is a weapon of nobility, and intended for dueling or ceremonial usage - not for use in heavy combat. These weapons valued aesthetics and lightness over military efficacy. You would never see a knight or a man-at-arms take a rapier into battle. It was a \"civilian\" weapon, much how hunting rifles and military rifles differ today. \n\nThe sabre was a cavalry weapon, and chosen for its ease of use in cavalry charges. The sabre's design makes it very efficient at slashing, which men on heavy horses charging toward other men would be doing, rather than longsword combat which was best done on foot. \n\nTo summarize, the longsword was the weapon of choice for antiquated fighting styles, and did not have a role in the new armies of the late Renaissance. The rapier and the sabre did play a role, however, in their own niches. The longsword did not so much give way or be replaced as die out, with other combat styles replacing it.

As long as they are sheets of paper, of course.\n\nWell, you'll need some way to know how to find stuff in there. If you just put your homework in one filing cabinet and then forget where it is, it would not be a very helpful filing cabinet!\n\nSo, you dedicate some of the filing cabinets right at the front for storing maps, or a gigantic index. This index says \"Your homework is stored in this location\", because you wrote that down when you put your homework away. This is called a File Allocation Table.\n\nAnother feature you'll want, right at the front where it's easy to find, is a list of what filing cabinets are not completely full. This helps you find where you should put your homework before you run out to the filing cabinet to put it away. This is called a free space map.\n\nAnother fun idea is to have a list of related pieces of homework that are easy to find. You'd put some note in your big master list, saying where to find information about this group of files. Then you'd go out to the filing cabinet where that information is stored, and that will point you to other files, or perhaps to notes about another group of related files. We will call this Directories.\n\nNow, what if you have a big report, and it's too big for just one file cabinet? Well, you can just put a special note at the end of the first file cabinet pointing to the next file cabinet that has the rest of the report!  Your index at the front just needs to point to the beginning of your report, and your free space map needs to know about the entire report, but you can just keep following your notes to read your entire report.\n\nNow, what happens if you get called to dinner while organizing your files? For example, you wrote down in your index that your homework is at one place, and you put it in the free space map, but you didn't actually have time to run out to the right filing cabinet and put it in there. If you were to completely forget about it, like most computers do when they get interrupted (powered off), then your homework would be lost forever, and attempts to find it by following your index would bring up nothing.\n\nSo, you could keep a Journal of what you are about to do. You'd write down at the front, saying \"I'm going to keep this homework in this filing cabinet\", and include a copy of the homework and everything in there. Then, you'd go out, fill in the index and the map, file the homework away, then cross off that item from your list. If you get interrupted like before, then you can just go back to your journal, see what things haven't been done yet, and then make sure they get done.\n\nNow that you know the principles behind file systems, different filesystems have different features:\n\n* FAT only supports the File Allocation Table and free space index idea.\n* HPFS is like FAT, except that it adds some extra features that were missing in the original version of FAT, like longer filenames, more precise timestamps, and general efficiency increases.\n* NTFS adds a journal on top, and fancy features like compression and encryption and extra notes about each file, including who should be allowed to look at them, enforceable by you.\n* ZFS and BTRFS are the latest generation of file systems, and they include really advanced features such as the ability to automatically store across multiple harddrives, and to detect when files get corrupted and to pull a good copy from the other harddrive, and store previous copies of files whenever you change them.","label":"comparison of different file systems","__index_level_0__":184}

Other cultures will have other ideas of what constitutes a male or female writing style...or perhaps none at all (e.g. there is no gender\/sex divide).\n\n\nI really recommend the book [Delusions of Gender](_URL_2_) by Cordelia Fine as an introduction this topic. \"Drawing on the latest research in neuroscience and psychology, Cordelia Fine debunks the myth of hardwired differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s brains, unraveling the evidence behind such claims as men\u2019s brains aren\u2019t wired for empathy and women\u2019s brains aren\u2019t made to fix cars. She then goes one step further, offering a very different explanation of the dissimilarities between men\u2019s and women\u2019s behavior. Instead of a \u201cmale brain\u201d and a \u201cfemale brain,\u201d Fine gives us a glimpse of plastic, mutable minds that are continuously influenced by cultural assumptions about gender.\"","label":"comparison of female fine motor skills to male fine motor skills","__index_level_0__":187}

These are merely my observations.\n\nI've graded some thousands of papers over the years, 1st-12th year.\nThere aren't that many differences, really.  What I've seen is that something like 33% of girls have \"boy\" handwriting, and some 25% of boys have \"girl\" handwriting.  The differences are in character spacing and size usually, not just neat or chicken-scratch.  Girls in grade school \/ high school typically use more than a line's intended height on capital letters, and more than half of the line on lower-case letters, while boys on the other hand, use less than the entire line for capital letters and still less than intended for lower-case.  This gives the girly-handwriting-individuals more room to swiftly curl their letters into formation, also while moving from letter to letter in the quickest manner possible which usually leaves swift swirly tails and end-bits on letters, making most seem \"bubbly\" or \"swirly\".  This is for those that write quickly, though.\n\nHowever, some people write just as quickly but still tend to use less than what is intended for height on their lettering.  These people write enough to make their lettering neat and tidy and compact, because they were forced to write quickly, but did not adapt the bigger, cleaner techniques.  These are the \"boyish\" handwriting ones, but the ones that look professional.\n\nThen some people write loads all of the time and write like a little kid, and probably always will unless they consciously feel the way they write and then do something about it.","label":"comparison of female fine motor skills to male fine motor skills","__index_level_0__":189}

{"text":"Hi there! Asian Studies major here!\n\nDepends on how you look at it. The pacific theater wasn't entirely complicated for America to enter and defeat the Japanese because a lot of the technology was given over to the Japanese after the Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1858 (also the same treaty that caused inner turmoil and removed power from samurai).\n\nJapan had 3 main colonies: Korea, Taiwan, and China. Korea was a testing ground for colony control and historically Taiwan was okay with Japanese control, but between Raping of Nanjing and Unit 731 a lot of this was unseen and won over islands and the Pacific Ocean and two huge infamous catastrophic nuclear warheads which are far more memorable in American history because it was a clean sweep.\n\nThe Japanese didn't have a scapegoat. When they lost, their population and leaders paid the price. The ideal bad guy from the Holocaust was a Nazi, not a German. This might seem minor, but this is key to make a point that this tragedy is not forgotten.\n\nAmerica had to take control of Japan and the southern half of Korea, which of course became complicated due to the Cold War and subsequently the Korean War. Japan was not punished and was integrated into America's capitalistic face lift to revive the war torn country (Godzilla is actually propaganda of Japan's fear for America's capitalistic influence released around the time they've signed an alliance treaty). Because of this turn around by Americans, Japan's youth has little spite for World War 2. This has caused both Japan and America to slowly blend better together as countries willing to move passed recent difficulties. We are allies and because of the strength of their economy and because we weren't about remembering horrific acts that we saw very little of (horrific acts that Japan was punished for), very little is taught or talked about between Japan and America (much like how we had Japanese-American citizens sent to internment camps during WW2).\n\nI say this is recent because it was less than 100 years ago when all of this occurred. America might not seem to be in the \"in\", but East Asia despises Japan. Many interest groups have demanded a solution for the damage Japan had caused to China (mostly petty large donations). Both Chinese and Korean people are still upset from Japanese occupancy. Twice in the past 10 years there was a major issue with Japanese history books distributed by Japan to Asian countries that nearly omits all of Japan's Korean\/Chinese actions. This caused more criticism for Japan.\n\nEven recently with *The Interview*, people forget that Sony is a Japanese company. North Korea is their neighbor. North Korea has threatened Japan on many occasions with nuclear weaponry (as empty of a threat as that may be, Japan is the only country who truly knows what its like to be hit with an atomic bomb). North Korea has stolen airplanes and held\/killed off Japanese hostages within the past few decades. They still resent Japan.\n\nThere is always a new headline once a year about Japan trying to move away from their past. They've been heavily criticized for openly apologizing because recent generations born after WW2 deny responsibility. My SO is Japanese and she admits to knowing very little about the Raping of Nanjing and she knew nothing about Unit 731 (human testing facility). She says that usually they don't try to paint any light on WW2 and tell it how it is, but I suppose the easiest way to avoid blame is to not mention\/detail acts seen as crimes against humanity.\n\nChina has major hostility over Japan. South Korea doesn't trust Japan. North Korea see's them as one of their biggest threats. America, as well as many other countries, filter out enlightening details, opinions, and events in history to keep history mostly neutral. One of the main reasons most history classes can detail and villainize Germans during WW2 is there is a separation of Germans and Nazis. This is why the war details of Japan in a high school history course start at when America is attacked and jumps to when America wins a few battles and drops the bomb.\n\nHope this clears some things up.","label":"comparison of the rape fo nanking to the holocaust","__index_level_0__":195}

You relentlessly over analyze and second guess everything you've ever done. Over and over. You relive your most embarrassing moments and find embarrassing things about other moments too.

This means a lot of things:\n\n1) Most of the jobs are subsistence farming, i.e. a very physical activity ([Wikipedia](_URL_0_) says 75% of working Kenyans made their living on the land). As such, the average Kenyan is in good physical shape.\n\n2) Because it's a relatively poor country, there isn't a lot of obesity like there is in other countries.

So the average Kenyan has some experience with running to begin with.\n\n4) Unrelated to their economy, Kenya has a higher altitude than many countries.\n\nIf you combine all of these things (better physical shape, lower BMI, plenty of physical activity, and a higher altitude), you end up with a group of folks with a high VO2 max. This means these folks can absorb more oxygen when breathing, which is key to marathoning, or doing any physical activity for an extended period of time.\n\nSo that explains why they're good long-distance runners.\n\nAs to why they compete in so many marathons, remember again that Kenya is a relatively poor country with very few non-farming jobs, and very little by way of secondary education.

Socialism can be ran by the state or anarchic, it can be national or a small community, it can be communist or have markets in it.  \nThe IMPORTANT part, which frankly no \"socialist\" country has actually achieved, is that the Means of Production are owned not by any one individual, by by the communities themselves. Some forms of socialism are merely means to implement communism too, which is a very specific type of socialism.  \nSo yeah, socialism is a huge over-arching term that covers a lot.\n  \n  \n**Democratic Socialism**  \nSo one of the first fracturing points in the socialist ideologies is HOW a society is going to implement socialism.

You will scarcely see any of us advocating for a recreation of the USSR.\n  \nNow, Democratic Socialism is simply socialism that intends to implement itself by playing the governments rules. In the U.S.A. this would mean electing DemSoc politicians who will attempt to lay the groundwork for a socialist society. Democratic Socialism also likes to \"Band-Aid\" the current capitalist system by helping the disenfranchised and marginalized through welfare.\n  \nHowever, this is still a socialism that is ran by the state, and you have whole armies of socialists who think this is absolutely silly and will just lead to more Authoritative State Socialist bullshit.\n  \nAnd, for the record,  \n**SOCIALISM =\/= GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS**  \nThat so completely misses the point that it hurts...","label":"comparison between democratic socialist and traditional socialist","__index_level_0__":287}

It's groundskeeping, maintenance, employees and services are all paid for by public tax dollars - for the public good - regardless of whether or not each individual in the community uses them. \n\nThe same can be said about roads, a fire department, social security, medicare, and schools. Even the military. None of these things are privately-held companies. We pay a tax because we decided it's better everyone has access to such services, rather than just those that can afford it. \n\nThere are various extremes of socialism.                         \nOn one end, we have Communism - in which all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs. The government\/communities own all the companies and will ration your needs for you. A major goal is to end classism through economic equality.\n\nOn a lesser extreme, we have Social Democracies. Note: this isn't to say that Communists cannot have democracies (free elections). Social Democracies are more of a 'hybrid' system, that exist within the framework of modern capitalism. \n\nAmerican Social Democrats not only support the socialist programs we already have in place in the United States, but would prefer to *expand* community services.

{"text":"Many answers have been given already but let me add a European\/historic take on the term socialist.\nIMHO and as I heard in a recent interview with a philosopher on Swiss TV the term \"socialist\" has been interpreted in a variety of ways in the past.\n\na) The first \"S\" in USSR stands for socialist while we would generally classify the USSR as communist.\n\nb) The other countries of the East Block (East Germany, Czechoslovakia, etc.) were also called socialist countries while allowing much more individual freedom and private property than the USSR.\n\nc) The \"leftist\"\/working-class parties in Western Europe (Sweden, Austria, Denmark, etc.) used to be called \"socialist parties\" and during the 80's\/90's changed their names to \"social-democratic\" parties. \n\nd) The leftist party in France (current president Hollande) is still called \"Socialist Party\" while not being anti-capitalist or pro socializing the Means of Production.\n\nSo you see, socialist has always meant different things in different times and places.\n\n\n\nI assume your original question refers to Bernie Sanders.\n\nHe appeared some 5 years ago on Bill Maher's show and called himself a social-democrat and frequently named the Skandinavian left parties as his political ideology. (I've been a fan of Bernie ever since.) Why Bernie now changed from social-democrat to democratic socialist, I don't know.\n\nTo clarify this again: None of the current social-democratic parties in Europe are anti-capitalist or want to take anyone's means of production and give them to the communities. They are in favor of capitalism and private ownership BUT also for high taxes on the rich and the (upper) middle class in order to \n\na) achieve redistribution of income and wealth from the top to the bottom\n\nb) pay for services provided by the government, e.g. public transport, public housing, free college, free pre-schools and kindergarten, free health care, etc. \n\n\nTo sum it up: I think Bernie does not want to fundamentally change the way American society and business function. He simply wants to make the US more European\/Scandinavian by raising taxes on the well-to-do and in turn provide more public services that disproportionately benefit the poor and the lower middle class.

Conversely, under socialism, all the workers own the widget factory, and then split the revenue generated by widget sales between themselves according to how much labor each person contributed.

{"text":"They aren't. They do not have the lawful authority to break into *any* private structure, business or residential, in the absence of something called *exigent circumstances.*\n\nBasically, an exigent circumstance is any situation in which *not* acting creates an unreasonable risk of harm to something or somebody. If a policeman were walking down the street and heard cries of \"Help! Help!\" coming from within a private residence, that policeman would (probably; depends on the exact circumstances) have the lawful authority to make entry to that residence, up to and including breaking the door in. That's because under that circumstance, the policeman would reasonably suspect that somebody was *actively coming to harm* in the residence at that time, and that waiting could cause that person to come to still greater harm.\n\nBut a noise complaint does not create an exigent circumstance. If somebody calls in a noise complaint on you, the police will come to your house, knock on the door, and *ask* to be invited inside so they can check things out. They will not break your door in, because there's no reason to believe it's an exigent circumstance.\n\nHowever, there is also the matter of what's called *probable cause.* Probable cause is the legal doctrine that says sometimes peace officers \u2014 policemen, sheriffs and so on \u2014\u00a0have the lawful authority to conduct an arrest or a search right there on the spur of the moment, without getting explicit judicial approval (i.e., a warrant).

{"text":"First, note that this is commonly said but not always true.  In Florida, for instance, first and second degree murderers get life without parole. Rapists get 25 years without parole.  There are definitely places with harsh penalties for other crimes, harsher than many people get for various kinds of hacking, particularly just one instance. That said, there are plenty of people who end up with really long sentences for hacking crimes, longer than some murderers, and definitely than say, someone guilty of involuntary manslaughter who might be in jail for only a few years.  \n\nSo why is that?\n\nIn the U.S. there is no single theory of how to punish people for the crimes they commit, and increasingly the punishment for any particular crime is statutory, meaning that Congresspeople or State legislators just sort of decide how bad they feel something should be, and put a number on it.  \n\nA common driver for high penalties for computer crimes was the idea of deterrence and bargaining.  Computer crimes can be hard to solve, since they are complex and can involve people from different parts of the country or the world.  They are also more \"tempting\" then many other crimes, since the tools are relatively available, there's less risk of being caught while \"failing\" given the anonymity of the internet, and the rewards seem high.  \n\nAs such, computer crimes were given fairly high penalties, and the crimes themselves were made narrow.  So you could charge someone with **many counts** of severe crimes as a way to leverage them into ratting out their helpers, or just accepting a plea bargain, rather than trying to teach a jury how hacking works.  It also deters in the first place (or is supposed to. Deterrence is really about not getting caught, rather than how much you're punished).\n\nThe various kinds of homicide have been around a lot longer, and the crime itself is simpler.  At the end of the day, the statutes for murder tend to be more straightforward, and so you don't end up with 10 individual counts of assault when you beat someone to death, they way you might end up with 10 counts of wire fraud for some hacking scheme. \n\nThe other issue is that many hackers are prosecuted under federal law, which tends to be harsher.  Most people who commit a homicide end up getting prosecuted in state court, which in some cases is more forgiving.  It is definitely ridiculous when someone who defaced a web page gets 10 years in federal prison without parole and someone who plead to voluntary manslaughter gets 8 years in a state prison with parole, but it's almost inevitable when you do criminal justice piecemeal.","label":"comparison of hacking and homocide","__index_level_0__":305}
{"text":"This has been asked many times, but I think having someone actually answer you personally causes you to get more out of the response. \n\nOverview of DNA\/RNA: Every cell in your body (not including your sperm or egg) have the same DNA. DNA is like a giant (and I mean giant) library. Individual units of DNA are called nucleotides (A,T,C,G) which act in segments of 3. Your cellular machinery reads these segments and produces mRNA (messenger RNA) in a process know as transcription. Then this RNA is sent to a ribosome which turns the mRNA into a protein in a process known as translation. This is called the central dogma (replication is also included in this). \n\nDevelopment: These expressed proteins (which were made from DNA)  can repress and activate DNA in itself and other cells around it, so in effect, can cause other cells around it to choose a cell pathway. Each cell starts as a stem cell and then, given these chemical signals, differentiates into something else. Initially the stem cell is totipotent (can become anything) it gets slightly differentiated and becomes pleuripotent (can become a few things). Eventually they become liver cells, heart cells, muscle, skin etc depending on the chemical signals they receive from the cells around them. Eventually these cells form really complex structures like the brain, nervous system, and body plan (body plan is regulated by hox genes). \n\nImportance\/controversy: A stem cell can form any organ theoretically, so they have a spectacular clinical application. The controversy around them comes from the mindset (not necessarily incorrect) that stem cells are living human beings (egg merged with sperm) and should have rights just like any other human being. It really depends on when you believe life begins. Embryonic stem cells are totipotent (can form anything) and are easily attained in vitro (in a test tube) when sperm and egg are merged to form a zygote (tiny baby). So the controversy mainly stems from a religious aspect (when does the soul or life force enter the body?). A huge issue with not pursuing further research is that other countries will be far advanced in medical practices, and US citizens will start going over seas for new medical procedures that we could perform here and give American doctors, nurses, and researchers jobs.","label":"defintion of stemcells and explanation of why they are controvesial","__index_level_0__":308}

{"text":"Short answer: they (usually) want to make money. Some of them have bigger fish to fry. Depends. Warning: The ELI5 explanation may not make sense at some points.\n\nQuick terminology guide: \n\n**malware** = all-encompassing term for viruses, adware, scareware, rootkits, anything that wants to inconvenience you. I use 'malware' and 'infection' interchangeably below.\n\n**virus** = any code that will replicate itself, whether by sending out infected emails, reaching out to networked computers to infect them, or transmission through any other vector. Thanks to the media, 'virus' and 'malware' are more or less interchangeable in society's eyes. They shouldn't be - not all malware is a virus, but all viruses are malware. \n\nThe rest is explained below.\n\n**ELI5**:\n\nYou've got four main types of malware. Scam infections, spyware, trojan horses, and rootkits.\n\nSay you're counting your money. You're doing so openly because you know the police (antivirus companies) will protect you if anyone tries to take your money.\n\nMost malware attempts to take your money. Some, like the scam infection, may dress up like a police officer and tell you that you're in a lot of danger, so you should give them your money. But they are not actually a police officer, they're just disguised as one! \n\nOthers are sneakier. Spyware will follow you to the bank without you seeing it and watch you give your money to the teller. Then it will disguise itself as you and ask the teller for your money.\n\nSome malware (trojans) doesn't even want your money. They want to use you for their own means. They'll put a saddle on you and make you butt heads with the bigger kids - and all the other little kids you know have saddles on them as well, and the viruses hope to use these numbers to cause damage to the big kids. *(edit: this is referring to botnets - I can't think of any real way to illustrate this to a five-year-old, sorry if it sounds stupid)*\n\nAnd then some malware, you can't even see! They're invisible. But this malware (rootkits) is usually backed by very powerful and evil men, and you won't even know they're there until they've slipped into your pants and given you a wedgie.\n\nFor anyone looking for something more comprehensive: \n\n**Scareware, adware and keyloggers\/spyware**\n\n\nContrary to what the media\/Hollywood would like you to believe, most of the malware that everyday computer users face is not the overnight work of some bespectacled nerd with a taste for chaos sitting in a dark room lit by dozens of CRT monitors. Rather, most malware nowadays is small-time, cheap exploit code that is aimed at doing one thing: making money. It does this by either:\n\n- getting you to outright pay them yourself. There are many infections that will act as fake antivirus programs (known as '[scareware](_URL_2_)') in order to get your credit card information; they establish themselves on a computer, start wreaking havoc, then bring up a window saying that the fake antivirus has caught some nonexistent issues. However, the scareware is always a free trial, and you have to buy the 'real' version for it to 'clean' your computer. Other infections will just lock you out completely until you enter credit card information.\n[Here is what your typical scareware looks like.](_URL_8_) Generally, these will have lots of spelling mistakes, horrible grammar, and one giant button that tells you you're in trouble and to buy the 'full version'. Also, note that it's finding viruses (these are fake entries) in all the places, accompanied with bogus or mismatched virus types. Most people can see through this, but the seniors or technologically-stupid of the world may not.\n\n- sitting behind the scenes and sending your information to others. This malware - generally referred to as 'spyware' - is often based around 'keyloggers', which will record your keyboard's keystrokes and upload them to a human controller; then, when the controller has information they deem useful (e.g. your online banking password), they can take your money.\n\n*Why?*\n\n\nAs mentioned above, these are almost purely profit-motivated infections. These types of malware rarely attempt to spread themselves to other users' computers. They want to raise as little suspicion as possible - you may not be as inclined to give out your credit card number to a message on your computer if your friends start calling you and telling you you're sending them spam emails. So, really, they are not viruses, but just infections - they are almost always contracted as a result of downloading something infected, be it an email attachment, bad file, or something from a shady torrent\/peer-to-peer site. \n\nThese infections can range from severe, like the two examples above, to mild, like most '[adware](_URL_6_)', which just spams your computer or changes certain links to lead to shady websites which try to sell you stuff. Adware, scareware and keyloggers are usually the easiest to get rid of, and comprise the brunt of infections that plague the world today. \n\n\n   **Trojans\/botnets**\n\n\nThat isn't to say worse things don't exist. Heavier infections, such as [trojan horses](_URL_4_), serve to compromise a user's control over a computer for various reasons, usually by making security holes (back doors) for malicious code to run through. Some trojan horses are deployed for the purposes of creating a [botnet](_URL_9_) - if many computers are infected with the same trojan, they become [zombie](_URL_0_) machines with which many things can be done. If you've ever read about 4chan's infamous DDOS attacks, for example, a botnet works in much the same way - large amounts of computers generate junk signals to overwhelm a target and bring it down through sheer brute force. \n\n   *Why?*\n\n\nThese types of infections are generally tooled towards causing chaos, and may be used to attack large websites or organizations by using the controlled computers to flood web servers en-masse in a [distributed denial of service attack](_URL_3_). They may also be used to farm bank information through a combination of trojan doorways and keyloggers. Botnets are rare, as they are nowhere near as easy to deploy as simple scareware, and operating a botnet is a high-profile digital offense, whether it's for DDOS purposes or harvesting information (see [here](_URL_1_) for an example of counter-botnet efforts).\n\n*Generally*, infections that exist to make their operators money are not run by skilled users. Those infections are mass-produced templates that are sold on the market to whoever wants to run them; they're shabbily-coded, often very easy to see through if you have the slightest clue about computers, and have a short lifespan (as antivirus programs will just update to defeat them after they're released). On the other hand, trojans, especially those used for botnets, take heavy-duty coding, coordination, and are usually run by more notorious groups. (relevant note: botnet controllers are generally known as herders or botherders)\n\n\n   **Rootkits**\n\n\nThe ultimate viruses - and this is where we start approaching Hollywood territory - are [rootkits](_URL_7_). These viruses are very hard to combat for one reason - they are able to actively hide their presence from the rest of the computer. Without going into excessive detail about the layers of an operating system, think of it like this: your computer is composed of two major parts, the hardware (physical, tangible box containing all the circuitry and whiz-bang that makes a computer run) and the software. These two parts act as a sandwich for a multitude of smaller layers that gradually fill the gap between reality and the digital world of an operating system, all for the purpose of taking a user's actions and translating them down to machine level so that the computer can do something with them. Rootkits can run beneath the top, or application, layer of the operating system, effectively cloaking themselves or making themselves impossible to remove without advanced techniques. \n\n\n   *Why?*\n\n\nRootkits are some of the most malicious code out there, and are developed by the best hackers in the industry. They are extremely rare, and most users will not run into one unless they're really unlucky. Due to the skill involved in making a rootkit successfully, few hackers know how to do so, and, if they manage to make a competent rootkit, antivirus companies will immediately start releasing protective updates to prevent them from taking hold on machines. \n\nRecently, we saw rootkits being used on an international scale for electronic warfare - see [Stuxnet](_URL_5_). Rootkits can be very, *very* complicated - Stuxnet was actually able to physically manipulate machinery. \n\nAnd then, lastly, some people just write viruses for fun, but this is a very small percentage.\n\n   **Addendum**\n\n\nIt should be noted that malware types are not mutually exclusive. Scareware can incorporate a trojan, a rootkit can incorporate scareware, etc. - generally, they stay exclusive because it's easier to do things that way (you want a rootkit to be as inconspicuous as possible, for example), but there's no hard and fast guide or 'Viruses 101' that says only one type of infection can be deployed at once, or that certain types can't contain elements of other malware. \n\n\n\n*EDIT #1*: added a bunch of Wikipedia links for further reading, expanded a bit on some sections, separated sections into virus definition and 'why'? for clarity, added introductory definitions.","label":"justification for making computer viruses and classification of malware","__index_level_0__":343}

{"text":"The reason why you pump your legs delves very deep into several areas of physics, which makes it all the more amazing that little kids use this trick seemingly intuitive.\n\nTo preface, it's not _only_ the leg pumping that gets you higher on the swing. You pump your legs forward _and_ move your upper body backwards. This achives two things which will become important later on.\n\nSo, your ride on the swing is governed by two rules, gravity and your potential energy\n\n    E=mgh, h is the height above ground\n\nit wants to pull you down. The second rule is inertia and  kinetic energy\n\n    E=mv\u00b2\/2, v is your velocity\n\nit wants you to travel in a straight line. \n\nDuring the ride, both types of energy are constantly changing into one another. For example, at the highest point your total energy is all potential energy (because h is big and v is zero, as you're not moving). At the lowest point all your potential energy gets converted to kinetic energy. That's why you're going fastest at the lowest point. I'm sure you get the idea.\n\nWhat's important to note is that while both types of energy will vary over time, your total energy stays exactly _the same_. This is what energy conservation is all about. \n\nIt also tells you that in theory, if you start swinging from a given height you will never be able to surpass that height, which results in a very boring swing ride if you start from the ground.\n\nThis is where the trick from earlier comes into play. \n\nWe've established that the only way you can go higher on the swing is by getting more energy to work with, so how exactly do you gain energy by merely pushing your upper body backwards?\n\nBy laying flat, you are pulling on the chain of the swing, so that your body is a little higher off the ground ([like this](_URL_0_)). That way, you have more potential energy than normal in the lowest position (because h is bigger) and have thus gained a little bit of energy, allowing you to go higher.\n\nEssentially, you're allowing your body to fall down for longer and are getting faster in return.\n\nNow, you might wonder if all we care about is getting our body as high off the ground as possible, then why do we tilt our upper body _downwards_?\n\nThis is where another important principle in physics comes into play, conservation of angular momentum.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity I'm not going to go into heavy detail about what exactly that is, but the gist of it is that if something is spinning (or not spinning) it will want to stay spinning (or not spinning).\n\nIf you look at the swing from the side again, you will see that pulling your upper body backwards and pumping your legs upwards essentially means you're rotating your body clockwise. \n\nNow, the whole system (you and the swing) started out _not_ spinning. That means something other than you has to spin _anti-clockwise_ to account for your clockwise spinning. \n\nAnd you guessed it, the swing is getting a little kick in the anti-clockwise direction. Causing you to go even faster and having the time of your life.\n\nEDIT: Fixed an explanation","label":"mecahnics of pumping your legs on a swing","__index_level_0__":353}

The result allows the image to be correctly focused on the retina.\n\n[Souce](_URL_0_)","label":"process of laser eye surgery","__index_level_0__":359}
{"text":"Bad eyesight of the sort that can be solved with laser surgery generally happens because the length of the eyeball doesn't match up with the focal point of the lens at the front of the eyeball. So instead of projecting a focused image onto you retina, the focus point is either in front of or behind the retina, and so what actually gets projected onto the retina is not in focus.\n\nWith laser eye surgery, they use a laser to reshape the surface of your eye (the cornea) which the light passes through before it gets to your lens. After being reshaped, your new and improved cornea acts like a lens, bending the light to make up for the shortcomings of the lens in your eye. \n\nYou can sort of think of it as instead of wearing glasses with lenses in them, the lenses are sculpted out of the front of your eye. \n\nI had my LASIK surgery almost 15 years ago, so the details might have changed some since then, but the first steps involved staring into a few different machines with lots of flashing lights and whatnot that made detailed 3D maps of my eyes. This was actually one of the hardest parts for me, because my eyes are rather sensitive to light, and not blinking and screwing it up was difficult.\n\nAnyways, the actual surgery was pretty easy. I had to lay back in a chair, and they put drops in my eyes that numbed them. Then they put a device over my eye that held it open. Then some machine went over my eye, and used suction to sort of hold it in place while they cut a small flap from the front of my cornea. When I got it done, the flap was cut with a blade, but I think they might use a laser for this now. Anyways, the suction part that held my eye still was the most uncomfortable part of the whole thing, it felt like my eyeball was being squeezed decently hard. I didn't like that much, but I was able to deal with it. \n\nThen they fold back the flap, and point the laser at your eye. I can't remember exactly, but I think that for me it took about 20 seconds or so of lasering per eye. The laser is computer controlled and knows where to shoot based on all that 3D mapping of your eye that was done earlier. I couldn't see the laser as it was burning away parts of my cornea, but there was a definite smell.\n\nThen when that's done, they fold the flap back over, and the doc makes sure there's no air bubbles or other stuff underneath it. This part was pretty interesting, because I could see him basically pushing and sort of brushing on the surface of my eye with some sort of swab or whatever, but I couldn't feel it because of the numbness. I actually asked the doc if he was rubbing on my eye, just because it was weird that I couldn't feel something that would normally cause me to flip out. \n\nRepeat for the other eye, and I was done. My vision for the rest of the day was kind of fuzzy and not great. When I woke up the next morning, I had almost normal 20\/20 vision. The eye heals very quickly. Within a couple of days, I had slightly better than normal vision. Awesome. The biggest rule post-surgery is to not rub your eyes for about 6 weeks. You don't want to loosen or tear that cornea flap. I had to wear these plastic shields over my eyes for the first week or so to keep me from rubbing them in my sleep. These shields were held on with some of the strongest tape I've ever seen. I pulled out a little chunk of my eyebrows one day because I accidentally taped over them. When my friend got her eyes lasered a few years later, she got silly looking goggles instead of those tape-on shields. Lucky her. I also had to put a couple different types of eyedrops in my eyes a few times a day for a week or so, but I don't remember what they were for.\n\nSome people, post-lasik, have had issues with night vision or dry eyes or other various symptoms, but I've never had any of that.

{"text":"I apologize for the length, but you've opened up a can of worms with this question. \n\nDescribing the historical Illuminati as just \"a group of free thinkers\" is a bit misleading. The order was essentially geared towards a strict regime of moral education, which involved writing monthly confessionals (the \"quibus licet\" reports) and spying on other members, as well as using the order's influences to get the supposedly morally superior initiates influential positions in order to *slowly* reform society to a utopian state where everyone would be so rational that any form of government would no longer be necessary. Adam Weishaupt, the founder, was heavily influenced by the writings of Antoine Court de G\u00e9belin and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who were both really big on ideas like primitivism and the noble savage. At the same time, the order was also extremely deceptive, using a variety of myths (such as claiming to be descendants of the Knights Templar) to attract members and it also had a very radical required reading list. As members advanced in the order, they were expected to read scandalous literature like d'Holbach's *Christianity Unveiled*. \n\nUntil the Bavarian government published *Einige Originalschriften des Illuminatenordens* and *Nachtrag von Weitern Originalschriften* in 1787, two large collections of confiscated order documents and really the main source of what we know about the order, the only real information on the Illuminati came from disgruntled defectors, especially the juridical deposits of Joseph Utzschneider and two of his colleagues, Cosandey and Gr\u00fcnberg. Utzschneider had defected in early 1783 after someone tried to coerce him to steal letters from the Duchess Marie Anne of Saxony, the former electress of Bavaria and an opponent of Hapsburg acquisition of Bavaria. To simplify an incredibly complex affair: Joseph II, the Holy Roman Emperor, wanted Bavaria; the Prince-Elector of Bavaria, Karl Theodor, wanted to trade off Bavaria; and Frederick the Great did not want Joseph II to get Bavaria. Joseph II had tried to take advantage of a succession dispute in 1777, when Karl Theodor had become the heir of Bavaria despite not really wanting it (he was already the Elector of the Palatinate), to achieve his goals but ended up losing a war against Frederick the Great instead. However, Joseph II had a new plan in 1783, which a majority within the Munich branch of the Illuminati supported, and Marie Anne had written to Frederick the Great to help put a stop to it. The letters Utzschneider were asked to steal were from Frederick the Great. So there was a clear political element in the suppression, and it's not surprising that the juridical deposit left by Utzschneider et al. says stuff like:\n\n > They also boast that they are in possession of the secret of opening and reclosing letters without the circumstance being perceived. \n\nand\n\n > The end sanctifies the means. The welfare of the Order will be a justification for calumnies, poisonings, assassinations, perjuries, treasons, rebellions; in short, for all that the prejudices of men lead them to call crimes. \n\nas well as\n\n > They made us give answers in writing to the following questions: How would it be possible to devise one single system of morals and one common Government for all Europe, and what means should be employed to effectuate it?\n\nThe first two are complete crock, of course, but I imagine that the third quote is a misinterpretation (if it did happen).  In *The Genesis of German Conservatism*, Klaus Epstein mentions that the equally incorrect idea that the superiors in the order had the \"power of life and death\" over their subordinates was very widespread.  It did not help that the authorities found a recipe for poison during a search of Xavier Zwack's house in 1786. In addition, the suppression of the Illuminati was a comparatively limited affair. Even though there were edicts in Mainz and Bonn (coupled with an edict issued by Joseph II that tried to bring freemasonry closer under imperial control), Bavaria was the only territory I'm aware of where members were actually arrested. Johann Bode would, with the support of the ruling dukes of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg and Saxe-Weimar, continue to direct the order from either Weimar or Gotha (not entirely sure which, unfortunately) until its demise in either 1787 or 1788, but he would also help establish the *Philadelphe* circle while visiting Paris in 1787 as well as the *Deutsche Freimaurerbund* in 1790, which was for all intents and purposes an extension of the Illuminati. So conspiracy theorists had plenty to work with, even though Bode effectively purged all radical elements out of the Illuminati and seems to mainly have been interested in masonic reform.\n\nThe *Originalschriften*, which would be joined by the third volume *Die Neuesten Arbeiten des Spartacus und Philo in dem Illuminatenorden* in 1793 (consisting of documents stolen by a defector), the juridical deposits, and other documents were all used by Augustin Barruel to support the idea that the French Revolution had been engineered by the Illuminati in his 1797 *Memoires Illustrating the History of Jacobinism*. John Robison, a scottish professor, published *Proofs of a Conspiracy* the same year, which makes essentially the same argument as Barruel. To simplify a bit, Robison and Barruel both saw the Illuminati as anti-Christian attempts to destroy the natural order of things born out of the radical elements of the French Enlightenment. Their books were incredibly influential and pretty much delineated the conspiratorial interpretation of the Illuminati, later authors have reinterpreted this depending on their anxieties but the core is the same. Nesta Webster tacked on an anti-semitic element into the whole affair and saw the history of the Illuminati as beginning before 1776, the John Birch Society saw Weishaupt as the originator of the Communist Conspiracy, and so on. The idea of a \"world domination\" oriented Illuminati may, if you'll forgive me for speculating, have come during the Cold War period.\n\n**tl;dr The Illuminati wanted Austrian acquisition of Bavaria. Bavarian loyalists defected and gave exaggerated testimony to demonize the order. House searches and confiscated documents seemed to support these claims, plus the continued existence of the Illuminati in Northern Germany was seen as evidence that they were still up to no good (despite it essentially being a masonic reform movement at this point). Robison and Barruel spun all of this into conspiratorial narratives about the french revolution, which later authors have interpreted depending on their own views.**\n\nSources:\n\n* Neugebauer-W\u00f6lk, Monika. \"Illuminaten\" in *The Dictionary of Gnosis and Western Esotericism*, ed.

When insurance was first becoming prevalent, life-threatening conditions were the major focus. This focus was reinforced by the fact that dental services operated independently from most healthcare systems.\n\nStarting in the 90s, state-regulatory boards started to greatly expand the mandatory coverage for certain ailments. For likely economic (cost) and practical reasons, dental insurance was never combined with medical insurance. But it likely had to do with public perception. See, the expansion of benefits started with breast implants for breast cancer survivors and increased with other heart-wrenching populations. And as a result, you had a situation where a state would dictated mandatory coverage for treatments with little\/no benefit, because it effected pediatrics, but ignore other populations like male breast cancer survivors. \n\nToday, new standards have been passed federally that should remove some of the glaring shortcomings of the state regulatory boards.

{"text":"When they first became extremely popular (around 1963 IIRC) their music was an unusual mix of different musical influences. They had good harmony, often had unusual syncopation, and had a songwriting team that had a way of coming up with very catchy melodies and hooks. Girls also thought that at least a couple of them were extremely cute, they had a hairdo that by the standards of the time was radical, Lennon in particular was very quotable, and McCartney was extremely likeable. These factors combined to ignite \"Beatlemania\". The record company and DJs loved to hype them up, and many adults loved to make fun of the way they looked. It was a kind of perfect storm that made them the most popular band in the world among teenagers.  \n  \nIf that was all there was to them, they would have gone down in musical history as a very popular band, but that's about it. But the Beatles' music evolved very significantly. With the help of a great record producer (George Martin) they first started incorporating classical instruments into their songs. This wasn't highly unusual at the time, but was something that was mostly done in more traditional ballads, not upbeat pop songs, and not carrying major melodic themes (usually). And then they started to experiment with other sounds. They would incorporate \"non-musical\" sounds into their songs, and play around with things like backwards masking and unusual instruments like the sitar. This kind of musical experimentation showed up quite a bit on \"Revolver\", but then reached a head on \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\".  \n  \nSgt. Pepper's cemented the Beatles' place in musical history. Even though there is only one real standout song on the album (\"A Day in the Life\"), the overall sound of the album ignited a revolution in popular music. (For example, the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson heard it and became musically paralyzed, saying there was no way that they could do anything that would compare.) It is difficult to appreciate how different that album sounded today, since so many bands have been influenced by what they did. But at the time, it was as if someone added a new dimension to sound. The Beatles had invented \"psychedelic\" music. Sgt. Pepper's was also one of the first rock albums made to be listened to as an entire album rather than just a collection of songs.  \n\nIt was as if the Beatles had first invented musical algebra in the Beatlemania era, and then went on and invented musical calculus with Sgt. Pepper's.","label":"signifigance of the beatles","__index_level_0__":529}

{"text":"DishonestStranger has a good summary regarding criteria for domestication. \n\nThe \"how\" can be complicated and appears to be different for different animals. \n\nThe prominent theory on dogs is that there was a \"self domestication\" that occurred many tens of thousands of years ago when humans lived in social groups alongside wolves. The \"most social and least fearful\" wolves would be kept around human living areas and could scavenge off refuse. Once these proto-dogs became completely comfortable around humans they were then bred for many different uses - hunting, herding, sledding, etc. Check the wiki on \"Origin of the domestic dog\" for more info. \n\nCat domestication was quite different, but is also thought to be a \"self domestication\" of sorts. Humans developed agriculture and started to organize into larger communities some 10 to 15 thousand years ago. The storage of grain and other produce, along with the larger communities attracted pests like mice and rats. Cats are obvious natural predators and the theory is that we tolerated and lived along side them because they gave us free pest control (and they are purry). \n\nFor other animals I do not know as much, I am only a layman but the domestication of dogs and cats is fascinating to me so I know a (tiny)  bit.","label":"process of domestication","__index_level_0__":603}
{"text":"This comment is most likely going to get buried, but if OP sees this I am happy. \n\nA lot of people get two things confused: Domestication, and tamed. From what I understand, any animal can be tamed. Being tamed just means you condition an animal to do certain acts. \n\nConditioning means learn, at the core. For example, if I have a dog and before he eats I make him sit down. The moment I feel he is ready to eat I ring a bell. Eventually, the dog will understand he can only eat after I ring the bell. This example may be off since I have not studied psychology for a long time, but I think I got the spirit of the experiment. \n\nSo for lions, elephants, and bears in circus', you tame animals. You teach them what is wrong and right through shocks, rings, bells, commands. Oh the elephant is going the wrong direction? Shock him. The tiger is starting to attack the trainer? Prod him. Though these are extreme examples, there are a lot circus' and other animal trainers who treat their animals with respect and understand how to properly and safely condition their animals. \n\nConditioning happens everywhere. \n\nNow there is domestication. Domestication is the genetic and change of animals so they have a *predisposition* to certain acts. Let me first define predisposition. So us humans, mostly those who work in the field of psychology, noticed that some animals (including humans) have behavior that they do no matter where they are. \n\nIf we hatch a bird across the world, where it has never been to, this bird will grow up wanting to chirp, wanting to fly, wanting to eat seeds, regular bird things. We attribute this behavior to its genetics.\n\nIt is similar in humans, in how we have certain behaviors we have a tendency to do. We have a tendency to be a family when the opportunity arises, we have the tendency to try to interact socially, we have a tendency to know want to learn new knowledge. We are genetically predisposed to do that. \n\nSo, the first people who domesticated dogs found a pack of wolves and one of the wolves decided, \"Maybe these two legged, hairless, apes may be nice to us?\" This may have been due to a genetic mutation. The \"engine\" of this wolf is actually different and it made it more nice. Who knows. But this wolf approached us and we bred it. We bred this wolf with other wolves who approached us. If we breed two nice wolves together, what happens is that there is a higher chance for these \"nice\" genes to pass along. Which they did, and this is how we have so many nice dogs around the world.\n\nTraits of domestication in animals are: floppy ears, tails that go up and curl, spots on their coat of fur, stuntedness, affinity to humans, \"small\" versions of their core animal groups, and there are others. \n\nPretty much, my dog Spot, was made genetically, over a course of many, many, **many** years to be tiny, big floppy ears, speckled body, and a tail that wags, through specific breeding of our ancestors. Whereas, I can go train a tiger and he can eventually learn to love me, I have to teach this tiger to do so, where I, you, or anyone can pick up a pup and it will mostly love you no matter what.","label":"process of domestication","__index_level_0__":604}

She lived with a British roommate, Meredith Kercher, and was dating an Italian man, Raffaele Sollecito. In November 2007, while Knox and Sollecito were out together, a man named Rudy Guede broke into Knox and Kercher's apartment and raped and murdered Kercher.\n\nGuede's guilt was thoroughly and irrefutably established by ample physical evidence. He protested that he had simply been burglarizing the apartment when someone else broke in and murdered Kercher. He later changed his story to some kind of bizarre sex game involving both Knox and Sollecito in which he himself was blameless.\n\nThe evidence against Knox and Sollecito is essentially nil. Prosecutors claimed to have found DNA evidence implicating them, but the alleged evidence was contaminated and mistreated, and to get any traces of DNA, the lab needed to perform experimental (and questionable) amplification procedures that they were not qualified for. There were also footprints that tested negative for blood, \"proving\" that someone had cleaned up the scene to conceal their involvement.\n\nIn addition to the \"physical\" evidence, the prosecution claimed that their conduct had been suspicious. You can google this if you want, but it's all inconsequential given that there was never any reason to suspect them to begin with. Much of it is ordinary character assassination \u2013 painting Knox as \"loose\" and a partier, that sort of thing, as though that were evidence of murder.\n\nAll three of them were convicted, Guede because he was clearly, unambiguously guilty and Knox and Sollecito because people are stupid and make stupid decisions when confronted with violent murder, sex, and international tensions. An appeals court overturned that verdict, largely citing a report pointing out that the alleged physical evidence was garbage. That court freed the two and ordered a new trial.\n\n---\n\nI did a bit more reading, to catch up with what's happened in the last couple of years. Addenda:\n\n- One of the \"suspicious\" things that Knox did was falsely implicate her boss. This occurred during an extended high-pressure interrogation during which Knox claims to have been mistreated. It turns out that the whole idea of her boss being involved was fed to her by the police based on their misunderstanding of the phrase \"see you later\" in a text message. Knox retracted the implication the next day.

However, DMSO is also toxic to cells at the concentrations necessary for cryoprotection.  Consequently, when you freeze cells in DMSO, you add the DMSO medium at ice-cold temperatures and don't allow the cells to warm up.  When you later thaw the cells, you have to dilute out the DMSO as quickly as possible without causing osmotic shock, which can pop the cells.  Such restrictions on freezing and thawing would basically be impossible to control at the level of a complete organism.\n\nHowever, to contradict a lot of previous posts, individual cells can be recovered from freezing with high viability.  When performed properly (and this varies quite a bit by cell type), you can expect  > 90% of cells to be alive following thaw.\n\nEdit - a more ELI5 explanation that I posted further down\n\nThe chemicals that allow cells to survive freezing are toxic to the body. Keeping the cells cold minimized the damage that this chemical does to the cells. With single cell solutions, adding the chemical at ice-cold temperatures and immediately diluting it out when you thaw the cells can keep 90% of the cells alive.
